This is a description of the AstroNat software for using the BibTeX
to create LaTeX documents suitable for submission to Astronomy
journals such as the AAS journals and MNRAS.

</P>
<P>
These files are based on Patrick Daly's natbib package, which may not
be distributed in exchange for money, other than distribution costs.
They are provided `as is' and are not guaranteed in any way.

is a collection of LaTeX, BibTeX and Perl software I put together
to allow the use of BibTeX to organize bibliographies when writing articles
for Astronomy journals.  The package not only produces LaTeX files which
obey the style rules for the journals, but can also make files which
follow the rules for electronic submission.  This eliminates a large
fraction of the considerable tedium involved in maintaining bibliographies 
and citations.

</P>
<P>
The basic idea is to prepare your document using the natbib citation
style and a bibliography style file for the journal.  Files for
electronic submission are then generated using a Perl script which 
inlines citations and removes the natbib dependencies.

</P>
<P>
As of AASTeX version 5.0, you no longer need the Perl script to submit
to ApJ.  But there is still no bibliography style file, so you will need
to use the one provided here.  Support for PASP conference series has
also been added.

<P>
Here are some reasons why this is good for you.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

References are stored in a bibliographic database (<CODE>bib</CODE>) file
in BibTeX format.  They can be easily downloaded from the Web
(for example the NASA 
<A HREF="http://adswww.harvard.edu/ads_abstracts.html">Astrophysics
Data System</A>), 
and never need to be entered into your computer more than once, 
reducing time spent hunting for typographical errors.

<LI>

All knowledge of the particulars of a given journal's style
for bibliographic entries is abstracted into the bibliography
style (<CODE>bst</CODE>) files.  This means that correct punctuation 
and formatting of the bibliography is handled for you.  It also 
means that changing from one journal's format to another 
becomes a matter of changing two or three lines of your file.

<LI>

Only the references which are actually cited in your work are
included from the database, so all your references can be stored
in a single place and you never have to worry about listing
references which are not cited.  Large <CODE>bib</CODE> files are
available on the Web for specific subject areas.

<LI>

Natbib has a very general and powerful citation mechanism which
can be used to produce a wide variety of author-year citations,
again without having to worry about typos or journal style.  It
also supports the traditional numbered citation style.  You can
get natbib bibliography style files for a variety of styles other
than the ones included here.

<LI>

References to the same authors in the same years are automatically
labeled with `a', `b', `c', etc. and sorted.

<LI>

RefTeX, AucTeX, and other packages provide excellent Emacs/XEmacs
interfaces (see section <A HREF="astronat_8.html#SEC16">Useful Emacs modes</A>) to BibTeX files.
</UL>

<P>
Of course, these advantages bring some additional complexity along
with them: you have to use the additional style files here, learn
the natbib cite commands, and use additional passes with latex and
bibtex when preparing the document (though Makefiles can do this 
automatically; an example is included).  For electronic submissions, 
an additional step is required using a Perl script to convert to 
<CODE>tex</CODE> and <CODE>bbl</CODE> files which obey the submission rules.
