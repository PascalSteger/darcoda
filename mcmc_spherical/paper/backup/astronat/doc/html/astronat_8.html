<H1><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC16">Useful Emacs modes</A></H1>

<P>
Emacs has a very nice RefTeX mode for editing <CODE>bib</CODE> files and
selecting citations.  XEmacs is particularly nice because you can easily
see most of the available commands in pull-down menus.  They allow you
to search for patterns in your database and select the reference you
want, with keystrokes for the different natbib cite commands.  You can
also automatically generate different types of entry for your <CODE>bib</CODE>
file, with all the appropriate fields in place.  Add the following
lines to your <CODE>.emacs</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
(autoload 'reftex-mode "reftex" "RefTeX Minor Mode" t)
(autoload 'turn-on-reftex "reftex" "RefTeX Minor Mode" nil)
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'turn-on-reftex)
</PRE>

<P>
This package is included in recent Emacsen, but the commands will
fail if you don't have it.
