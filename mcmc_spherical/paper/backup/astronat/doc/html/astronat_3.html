<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC4">Usage</A></H1>

<P>
This section describes how to use the software.  First make sure you
have the necessary files in the right place, or have environment
variables set appropriately (see section <A HREF="astronat_2.html#SEC3">Installation</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC5">Bibliography Files</A></H2>

<P>
Now we describe how to set up your BibTeX <CODE>bib</CODE> files.
If you are familiar with BibTeX already you can probably skip
this section.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC6">Bibliography database files</A></H3>

<P>
Using BibTeX, your references are stored in a <CODE>bib</CODE> file, 
for example <CODE>myrefs.bib</CODE> (the <CODE>.bib</CODE> suffix is important).
These need not (indeed, should not) be limited to the articles you
are citing in the document you are preparing; BibTeX picks out the
ones you actually cite and only includes those in your bibliography.

</P>
<P>
A typical entry in a <CODE>bib</CODE> file looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
@Book{Peebles:94,
  author =	 {P.~J.~E.~Peebles},
  title = 	 "Physical Cosmology",
  publisher = 	 "Princeton University Press",
  year = 	 1994,
  address =	 "Princeton, NJ"
}
</PRE>

<P>
or like this:

</P>

<PRE>
@Article{1997ApJ...485....1M,
  author = {Myers, S.~T. and Jonathan E.~Baker and Readhead, A.~C.~S. and
            Erik M.~Leitch and Herbig, T.},
  title = "Measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect...",
  journal = apj,
  year = 1997,
  month = aug,
  volume = 485,
  pages = "1--8",
}
</PRE>

<P>
Other types include 
<CODE>@Booklet</CODE>,
<CODE>@InBook</CODE>, <CODE>@InCollection</CODE>, <CODE>@InProceedings</CODE>,
<CODE>@Manual</CODE>, <CODE>@MastersThesis</CODE>, <CODE>@PhDThesis</CODE>,
<CODE>@Proceedings</CODE>, <CODE>@TechReport</CODE>, and <CODE>@Unpublished</CODE>.
The <CODE>@Misc</CODE> type is a catch-all which allows you to do the
formatting yourself if necessary.  Most of these types should give 
correct results for the journals using the <CODE>bst</CODE> files included
here for AAS and MNRAS.

</P>
<P>
The first thing after the { is the cite key, which you use to cite
the reference in your document.  Note that author names can have
either first or last name first, and they are separated with <CODE>and</CODE>.
Very long lists can be truncated with <CODE>and others</CODE>.  Natbib's 
automatic lettering will get confused if the author last names are
not punctuated consistently (e.g., if some of them have extra braces
as in ADS style and others don't).

</P>
<P>
Emacs (see section <A HREF="astronat_8.html#SEC16">Useful Emacs modes</A>) has a very nice set of commands for automatically
generating a bibliographic entry in a <CODE>bib</CODE> file.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC7">Using String Abbreviations for Journals (optional)</A></H3>

<P>
BibTeX will complain if it does not know the definition of a string
which is not enclosed in quotes, such as the strings <CODE>apj</CODE> and
<CODE>aug</CODE> in the example above.  References downloaded from ADS will
have <CODE>"\apj"</CODE> instead of <CODE>apj</CODE>; this tells BibTeX to write
<CODE>\apj</CODE> in the bibliographic entry.  This is fine for AASTeX macros,
where the <CODE>\apj</CODE> command is defined in the style file.  But if
you are using a style file which does not define this command, you
will get errors from LaTeX unless you define it yourself.

</P>
<P>
One way to handle this is to use the journal abbreviation <CODE>bib</CODE>
files such as the ones included here, <CODE>apj-jour.bib</CODE> or 
<CODE>mn-jour.bib</CODE>.  These contain commands such as

</P>

<PRE>
@STRING{apj = "\apj"}
</PRE>

<P>
in <CODE>apj-jour.bib</CODE> and

</P>

<PRE>
@STRING{apj = "ApJ"}
</PRE>

<P>
in <CODE>mn-jour.bib</CODE> which define the strings if you use a command like
<CODE>\bibliography{apj-jour,myrefs}</CODE> or
<CODE>\bibliography{mn-jour,myrefs}</CODE> in your document 
(see section <A HREF="astronat_3.html#SEC8">Preparing the LaTeX Document</A>) to include the <CODE>bib</CODE> files.  This way 
you don't have to change your <CODE>bib</CODE> database for different 
journals, and you don't have to define a lot of new journal 
commands in your LaTeX document.  Look at the files to see all 
the defined abbreviations.  The very short abbreviations such as 
"ApJ" for frequently cited journals are included, along with many
others following the IAU convention.

</P>
<P>
The three-letter month abbreviation strings
and strings for a few mathematics journals are defined in the
bibliography style (<CODE>bst</CODE>) files.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC8">Preparing the LaTeX Document</A></H2>

<P>
First include the natbib style file.  For LaTeX 2e,

</P>

<PRE>
\documentclass{ ... }
\usepackage{ ... ,natbib}
</PRE>

<P>
or for LaTeX 2.09 (required by the journals),

</P>

<PRE>
\documentstyle[ ... ,natbib209]{ ... }
</PRE>

<P>
Place the natbib package last in your list of packages to make
sure it doesn't get over-written.  It works with the AASTeX styles
as well as the <CODE>emulateapj</CODE> style, and with the <CODE>mn</CODE> 
style (mostly, but see section <A HREF="astronat_6.html#SEC14">MNRAS style</A>).

</P>
<P>
Second, somewhere in the preamble (before <CODE>\begin{document}</CODE>),
use the command 

</P>

<PRE>
\citestyle{aa}
</PRE>

<P>
This simply insures that natbib gives you citations which look
like (Bester 1998) and not like (Bester, 1998).  The <CODE>aa</CODE>
stands for Astronomy &#38; Astrophysics, but this citation style
is appropriate for all the journals.  (Actually, the code 
<CODE>nat2jour.pl</CODE>, which prepares files for electronic
submission, produces citations like this regardless of the
<CODE>\citestyle</CODE> command, so this does not matter for the
final output.)

</P>
<P>
Next, at the point where you want the bibliography to appear, use

</P>

<PRE>
\bibliographystyle{STYLE}
\bibliography{REFS}
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>STYLE</CODE> is the name of the bibliography style you want to
use (e.g., <CODE>\bibliographystyle{apj}</CODE> to use <CODE>apj.bst</CODE> -- 
leave off the <CODE>.bst</CODE> suffix).  <CODE>REFS</CODE> is a list of 
bibliography files to use (leave off the <CODE>.bib</CODE>).  So if you 
wanted to use the ApJ journal abbreviations (see section <A HREF="astronat_3.html#SEC7">Using String Abbreviations for Journals (optional)</A>)
and a database called <CODE>myrefs.bib</CODE>, 

</P>

<PRE>
\bibliography{apj-jour,myrefs}
</PRE>

<P>
This loads the journal definitions from <CODE>apj-jour.bib</CODE>, so you can
use things like <CODE>journal = apj</CODE> in <CODE>myrefs.bib</CODE>. 

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC9">Citation commands</A></H2>

<P>
The natbib package defines a number of very useful citation commands
which replace the usual <CODE>\cite</CODE>.  These are really necessary
in any author-year citation system, where you don't always cite a
reference using the same format for the citation.  These commands
and their output are illustrated below.  The most frequently used
are <CODE>\citet</CODE> (textual cite) and <CODE>\citep</CODE> (parenthetical cite).
<CODE>\cite</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>\citet</CODE>, but this shouldn't be
used because it is often defined by other style files.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\citet{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
Bester et al. (1998)

<DT><CODE>\citep{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
(Bester et al. 1998)
</DL>

<P>
Multiple citations work within a single cite, for example

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\citep{KEY1, KEY2, KEY3, KEY4, ...}</CODE>
<DD>
(Bester et al. 1998; Garibaldi et al. 1997, 1998a,b; ...)
</DL>

<P>
The lettering of the citations and references is done automatically.

</P>
<P>
You can use optional arguments to get text before and after the
citation(s):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\citep[hereafter B98]{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
(Bester et al. 1998, hereafter B98)

<DT><CODE>\citep[e.g.,][]{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
(e.g., Bester et al. 1998)

<DT><CODE>\citep[see][p. 68]{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
(see Bester et al. 1998, p. 68)
</DL>

<P>
Any of these can have a <CODE>*</CODE> affixed to make a full author list
when "et al." would normally be used, e.g.,

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\citet*{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
Bester, Winters, &#38; Alexander (1998)
</DL>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>nat2jour.pl</CODE> script takes care of the bizarre 
practice of listing three names on the first citation and using 
"et al." thereafter, so you don't need to worry about that,
although the intermediate file will come out "wrong".

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\citeauthor{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
Bester et al.

<DT><CODE>\citeyear{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
1998

<DT><CODE>\citeyearpar{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
(1998)
</DL>

<P>
<CODE>\citealp</CODE> and <CODE>\citealt</CODE> are the sames as <CODE>\citep</CODE>
and <CODE>\citet</CODE>, respectively, except that they do not produce
any parentheses at all:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\citealt{KEY}</CODE>
<DD>
Bester et al. 1998
</DL>

<P>
Finally, <CODE>\citetext</CODE> can be used to place arbitrary text 
around a citation.  Look at the comments in the natbib style
files for more information.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC10">Processing LaTeX/BibTeX files</A></H2>

<P>
When you process a document for the first time, or when you add citations
to new references, you have to go through four steps.  For a file called
<CODE>foo.tex</CODE> with a bibliography <CODE>refs.bib</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>1. <CODE>latex foo</CODE>
<DD>
Stores the citation keys in the <CODE>aux</CODE> file

<DT>2. <CODE>bibtex foo</CODE>
<DD>
Creates a bibliography (<CODE>.bbl</CODE>) file

<DT>3. <CODE>latex foo</CODE>
<DD>
Incorporates the <CODE>bbl</CODE> information

<DT>4. <CODE>latex foo</CODE>
<DD>
Gets all the citations and cross-refs right
</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>.bbl</CODE> file is a normal-looking LaTeX file containing
the <CODE>\thebibliography</CODE> environment; it is inserted into the
document at the point where the <CODE>\bibliography</CODE> command is
issued.

</P>
<P>
If you are producing an article for electronic submission, you can
stop after step #2, run <CODE>nat2jour.pl</CODE> (see section <A HREF="astronat_3.html#SEC11">Generating a Copy for Electronic Submission</A>) and
then run LaTeX (twice) on the output.

</P>
<P>
It's not too difficult to automate this process (see section <A HREF="astronat_7.html#SEC15">Makefiles</A>)
and speed things up.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC11">Generating a Copy for Electronic Submission</A></H2>

<P>
Your article looks great now, but in the shape it's in as of the
last section, you'll have to use a decidedly low-tech method
of submitting it to the journal: print it out and snail-mail it in!
This is because you cannot include complex style files like
<CODE>natbib.sty</CODE> with your submission, and the journals don't
provide bibliographic style files.

</P>
<P>
(As of AASTeX version 5.0, this is no longer true!  You can stop here
and simply submit your <CODE>tex</CODE> and <CODE>bbl</CODE> files.  But the 
`minor tweaks' mentioned below won't be performed, so you'll have to
do them by hand.  For instance, use the <CODE>\cite*</CODE> commands rather
than <CODE>\cite</CODE> commands the first time you cite a reference with
three authors, to get all the names.)

</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there is a Perl script, <CODE>nat2jour.pl</CODE>, which
comes to the rescue.  It takes the <CODE>tex</CODE> and <CODE>bbl</CODE> files
you have made (see section <A HREF="astronat_3.html#SEC10">Processing LaTeX/BibTeX files</A>) and makes new ones which you
can actually submit.  This is accomplished by

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

inlining all the citation commands properly

<LI>

removing all dependencies on natbib

<LI>

spitting out <CODE>\bibitem</CODE>'s with the right format
</UL>

<P>
A few other minor tweaks are also performed; you may notice some
small style errors in the document before processing it.
For input files <CODE>foo.tex</CODE> and <CODE>foo.bbl</CODE>, invoke
it by typing 

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>nat2jour.pl foo</CODE> 
</PRE>

<P>
(make sure it is executable
and in your <CODE>PATH</CODE>).  By default it will make new output files 
<CODE>foo-aas.tex</CODE> and <CODE>foo-aas.bbl</CODE>, but you can name
them something different by specifying a second argument.

</P>
<P>
The new files can be processed completely independently of
the natbib <CODE>sty</CODE> files, the <CODE>bst</CODE> files, and your
<CODE>bib</CODE> files.  The bibliography is simply pasted in from
the <CODE>bbl</CODE> file, so all you need are the <CODE>tex</CODE> and
<CODE>bbl</CODE>, with the usual one or two passes with <CODE>latex</CODE>
to process them.

</P>
<P>
The code has two options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-inline</CODE>
<DD>
Inlines the bibliography so you end up with a single, stand-alone
<CODE>.tex</CODE> file.  The default leaves the bibliography in a separate
<CODE>.bbl</CODE> file.

<DT><CODE>-maxauth</CODE>
<DD>
Change the maximum number of authors before <CODE>et al.</CODE> is used;
default is 8.  Set to zero for no limit.

<DT><CODE>-references</CODE>
<DD>
Rather than generating the default <CODE>thebibliography</CODE> environment 
with <CODE>\bibitem</CODE>'s, generate a <CODE>references</CODE> environment.  This
also leaves off the <CODE>\markcite</CODE> or <CODE>\nocite</CODE> commands.  I
found it was necessary for preparing a PASP conference proceeding.
</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>nat2jour.pl</CODE> code looks for a <CODE>\documentstyle</CODE> 
containing "mn".   If it finds it, it adds <CODE>\nocite</CODE> commands next 
to the inlined references; otherwise it adds the AASTeX <CODE>\markcite</CODE>
command (unless the <CODE>-references</CODE> flag is set).

</P>
<P>
The code also ensures that three-author papers are cited as
Bester, Winters, &#38; Alexander (1998) on the first citation and
as Bester et al. (1998) thereafter.  This will not be the case
in the <STRONG>input</STRONG> files because natbib does not do this.  In
addition, it truncates long author lists at the right point (8
authors, natbib doesn't do this).

</P>
<P>
Finally, the code may alter the appearance of the typeset
bibliography, because natbib may redefine the <CODE>\thebibliography</CODE>
environment in the input files.  The output files will conform to the 
other style files (such as AASTeX) you are using.

</P>
<P>
Note that the script should work on <CODE>bbl</CODE> files produced
with <STRONG>any</STRONG> <CODE>bst</CODE> bibliography style, as long as it
produces <CODE>\bibitem</CODE> commands which exactly follow this format:

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>\bibitem[{ SHORT-AUTHOR-LIST (YEAR) LONG-AUTHOR-LIST }]</CODE>{ <CODE>KEY</CODE> }
<CODE>BIBLIOGRAPHIC-ENTRY-TEXT</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>LONG-AUTHOR-LIST</CODE> may be omitted when it is the same as the 
<CODE>SHORT-AUTHOR-LIST</CODE> (usually, &#60;3 authors).  This is the
"extended natbib" format used by natbib versions 5.3 and later.
The script will become confused in the unlikely event that there are 
square brackets in the author lists.  The <CODE>\bibitem</CODE> entries must 
be separated by blank lines.
