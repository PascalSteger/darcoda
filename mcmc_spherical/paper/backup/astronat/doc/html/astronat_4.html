<H1><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="astronat_toc.html#TOC12">Problems and Troubleshooting</A></H1>

<P>
1. <STRONG>LaTeX can't find some files</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Check you environment variable set up, or make sure the right files
are in the directory with your document (see section <A HREF="astronat_2.html#SEC3">Installation</A>).

</P>
<P>
2. <STRONG>nat2jour.pl produces strange results</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Look at the diagnostic output from LaTeX or the <CODE>log</CODE> files.  
Make sure the <CODE>bst</CODE> file it
is including is coming from the correct directory (other packages
such as astrobib also have a file called <CODE>apj.bst</CODE>, and this
may be lurking somewhere on your system; make sure it doesn't get
found first).  The items in your input <CODE>bbl</CODE> file should conform
<STRONG>exactly</STRONG> to extended natbib style (see section <A HREF="astronat_3.html#SEC11">Generating a Copy for Electronic Submission</A>).

</P>
<P>
3. <STRONG>Some references or citations look wrong</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
This maybe a bug, but I have tested the common ones listed on the
journal web-pages so you might
be doing something exotic.  Anyway, when was the last time someone
submitted a paper with a perfect bibliography?  :)  Check your
<CODE>bib</CODE> file for spurious entries.  Also check the instructions 
for authors 
(<A HREF="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/">ApJ</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.blacksci.co.uk/">MNRAS</A>) to see that it really
is wrong.  Then you can send a bug report to 
<A HREF="mailto:jbaker@draco.berkeley.edu">jbaker@draco.berkeley.edu</A>; include the entry from the
<CODE>bib</CODE> file and the result in the <CODE>bbl</CODE> file (and <CODE>tex</CODE>
file, for a citation problem).  You can do the formatting by hand
by using a <CODE>@Misc</CODE> entry.  Note that lettering will not work
if some the last names in the <CODE>bib</CODE> file are not punctuated
consistently (e.g., some have extra braces as in ADS style and
others don't).

</P>
<P>
4. <STRONG>BibTeX gives warnings about entries</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
It can be somewhat persnickety about what fields are allowed for
a certain type of entry.  Make sure you're not using spurious ones.

</P>
<P>
5. <STRONG>Abbreviations used for a reference (like JEB98) aren't added to the \bibitem's</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
No, they're not.  :)  You can usually get the effect by using a "note"
field in your <CODE>bib</CODE> entry.

</P>
<P>
6. <STRONG>LaTeX crashes with mn.sty</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
There are two lines which cause trouble; use <CODE>mn-nat.sty</CODE>
(in the <CODE>mn</CODE> subdirectory) instead (see section <A HREF="astronat_6.html#SEC14">MNRAS style</A>).
