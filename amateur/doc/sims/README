Here is some information on the simulations:


The best resource is the website: http://dipastro.pd.astro.it/~cosmo/
which contains all the relevant information for the Tarkin simulation 
outputs contained in this directory. At the bottom of that page there 
is a link called "Kenobi" which contains among many other things, sample 
codes that read the snapshot outputs in IDL, fortran 90 and C. 

The directories in the SIM directory are:

- Documentation/: README           : This file
  		 SIMconnection.txt: The information on how to ftp 
				    simulations from the Padova site
		 Tarkin_snaps.txt : a list of the snapshot number (in the 
    				    snap/, gv/ and gi/ directories) and  
				    the corresponding redshift
                 tarkin_redshift.txt: A list from Padova with all snapshots 
                                      and their corresponding redshift

- snap/: snap_XXX are the binary files corresponding to the XXX snapshot 
	outputs. In order to read them, start by looking at one of the 
        read_GADGET codes in the Kenobi site (see above). 

- gi/ : SO.XXX.gi, the binary files that list the particle id's that belong to 
        each identified halo. The reading format is given on the Kenobi 
        website.

- gv/ : SO.XXX.gv, the ASCII files from the halo finder with the information 
        about each identified halo in a given snapshot. Again, look at the 
        Kenobi site for a description of the different columns. 


Let me know if there is anything else I can do. 

Good luck playing with these,
