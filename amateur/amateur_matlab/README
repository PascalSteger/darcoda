Figure naming conventions
=========================

Each Matlab script gets a number and a description in the format

> fig0110_some_nice_plot_but_with_errors.m

and a corresponding entry in figures.txt. Each time there is a graph
worth publication, there is a *.eps in ../report/fig/ together with
output prepared for S/M.
