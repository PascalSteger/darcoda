To be done:
===========

Scientific goals
================
* mass bin function of single halos in the outskirts
* run AnalyzeSnap with exclusion of unbound particles
* search correlation between j_stars and j_dm, as it is important to be able to track the dm halo properties by the stars
* mass buildup history as fct of z for the three main halos in one graph. if too different, forget addup
* history of e_1_dm,e_1_stars before/after infall: should evolve to bigger numbers, as torquing is important for short time
* galaxy rotationally supported? random motion?
* new fitting formula for lambda (not only -x^2 in log-log-plot)
* is there disagreement between COM for baryonic and dm? >10" from Shan+2010

* is there a possibility for generating "cold spots" 
  from lensing of early matter distributions?

Coding goals
============
* creation of sample simulation output for use in order to verify code
* HaloTracker invoked by amateur directly using another commandline option
* variable names the same in Halo, TidalField, AnalyzeSnap, Matlab
* check of bndry handling
* Halo: percentage of low resolution particles
* Halo: gas mass fraction
* Halo: add lambda_R parameter given in Emsellem+2007
* Halo: T,S parameters

Nice to do
==========
* include wrapper #ID_PARTICLEINFO => MergerTree in AMIGA
* include subhalo matcher for autocorrelation runs in AMIGA
* use SM to generate plots, use big plots in draft versions of article

Final steps for amd report
==========================
* add info: field halos have too little gas
  to be included appropriately in the analysis
* fig.4 as fct of #particles
* stars: a/c vs n_particles: numerical effect? for all galaxies/subhalos
* nice output for tidal field eigenvectors
* 4 panels for (Jgas,Jdm) correlation as fct of radius; check statistics
* panel of (ea,t3) with exponential fit for right part
* 4 panels for (r,ea) (massbins, dm/gas)

to be checked
=============
* gas have smallest velocity dispersion

problems
========
* Aprop.txt has no useful entries (-o not working)
* halos with 200000 particles have no stars? no gas? 
  => particle ID problem?
* no proper input from Hprop.txt
