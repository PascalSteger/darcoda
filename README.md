Codes for Mass Modelling of Spherical and Disk-Like Structures

Basic MCMC framework
--------------------
Lead: Justin
Tests with linear / quadratic interpolation;
dependence on the number of stellar tracers;
behavior with dark matter density prior;
Pascal: setup GIT repository

Milky Way
---------
Lead: Justin / Pascal / Dave
Tests with simulated disk galaxy;
compilation of stellar tracers in the solar neighborhood;
determination of actual DM profile;
...

Spherical systems
-----------------
Lead: Pascal
Replacement of buggy integration scheme;
extension to include anisotropy parameters;
application to triaxial systems.
Test problems should appear online here soon: http://astrowiki.ph.surrey.ac.uk/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=start

Application to observations
---------------------------
Lead: Pascal
Compilation of dwarf galaxy data;
model for outliers (foreground contamination, binary stars);
method to break mass-anisotropy degeneracy;
tests with simulated dwarfs;
determination of actual DM profiles;
comparison with non-equilibrium chemistry (NEC) simulations.
Data for four dwarfs is here: https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~mwalker/mmfsdata.html. We can get started with those.
