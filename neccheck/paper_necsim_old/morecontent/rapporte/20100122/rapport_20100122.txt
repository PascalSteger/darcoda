Recommendations for good talks
==============================

A good scientist with ability to perform research by himself asks

Where am I now?
Where do I want to get?

What is my problem?
How do I tackle it?
Why do I use this tool?
What are the implications involved?
Do I want them?
Is there a better way?
What do I have to study more intensively?

If we only use tools and crunch numbers, we are a good companion in a collaboration, but not a scientist with leadership and management skills.


Good talks about a long period of working include:

* _introduction_: DON'T be ashamed of assuming your listeners do not know about your area as good as you do
* _specific_ problem, in big context
* only main work mentioned
* additional papers do have my name in it, of course, but not as 1st author
* methods: mention as "black boxes", input, output:
* absolute need: keep listener interested in what you're doing, for sake of completeness
* answer to the problem, encapsulated in funny words (if applicable)

* KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
  where do they come from
  what are they most familiar with
  what do they expect from you
  how can you help them
