Dear Oliver,

here are the topics concerning the article for angular momentum alignment I talked over with Marcella and Prof. Teyssier. 

[+] search for softening scale of simulation,
  	Plummer's equivalent width of $7.5h^{-1}kpc$, from the tarkin homepage
[+] discussion of too little gas particles in these halos
[+] discussion of the fact that AGN feedback is missing in our simulation
  	short note inserted in article
[+] check for alignment between j_stars and j_dm in order to track 
    dark matter distribution by stars, and to search for possible torquing
  	histogram of cos(j_dm,j_stars) has a clear peak at 1, but a median 
	of only 0.6
[-] mass buildup history as fct(z) for all three halos, forget stacking 
    if too different
        not possible actually, as we only can access the snapshots of 
	one resimulated clusters back to z\sim9
[ ] search for correlation between e_1_dm and e_1_stars 
    	1. before infall 2. after infall
  	need a condition to determine event "infall"; my first try will be 
	checking for a new classification as subhalo from AHFstep

[o] check if galaxies are rotationally supported by a plot of V/\sigma
  	needs modification of AnalyzeSnap and rerunning code
[ ] a/c of star component as fct of n_particles for all subhalos
    	yet only c/a from AMIGA for all particle types, showing median 0.74

[ ] find mass scales of importance of the outskirt halos
[+] cos(j_dm,j_gas) as function of mass/particle number
        cos(j_dm,j_gas) (not abs!) with median 0.36, higher for massive halos
	at \geq 10^12h^{-1}M_sun
	no discreetness effects visible, also if plotted as fct of #particles

As a preparation for further investigations with halo histories, I'd like to incorporate HaloTracker, or search for another way to track halos that includes addition of particles.
