water maser (microwave/molecular amplified stimulated emission radiated)
===========
* black hole in center of a rotating disk (inside bulge of a galaxy with bulge)
* velocity of gas patches perpendicular to direction to observer and all material in a small arc in direction of observer is approximately the same; light is emitted at same phase


ultrafaint dwarfs
=================
mass \sim 1000M_\odot

lightest superposition of SUSY particles lies in the vicinity of LHC, and gives a good example for WIMP dark matter

REPO code
=========
corrotating grid, very small artificial angular momentum loss


Eddington limit
===============
: (formula)
Accretion onto black hole is limited by the finite cooling rate of material and therefore only limited angular momentum loss. This implies also that the relation


Bondi-Hoyle accretion
=====================
???
