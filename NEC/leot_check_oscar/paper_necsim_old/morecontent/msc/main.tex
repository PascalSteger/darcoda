simulation: why
2.9 from Binney/Tremaine
different codes, described accurately:
cosmological / star formation
resimulation technique
Gadget2
- description of tarkin
- characterization of small simulation, resimulation
Ramses
Gasoline
influence of different resolution
problems in simulation:
- overcooling (too much low angular momentum material in centers of galaxies)
- resistance from cell borders

comparison to actual observations with Sunrise

description of the main code parts:
- halo/subhalo finder: Amiga, AHF;
	include subhalo finder, merging, structure definition
- Halo
	angular momentum NOT with shells, use classical definition
	correction for unbound particles additionally included, although 
	amiga does it by itself
	procedure for determining virial radius/mass
	Eigensystem for shape
- tidal field:
	cloud in cell
	fourier analysis
	evaluation at pos of galaxies
	different scales
- correction for numerical artefacts: exclusion of too small/unresolved halos

statistics
	correlation
	crosscorrelation

findings:
	ordered rotation: using lambda, sigV
	subhalo mass function
	definition of lambda, sigV
	computation routines
	correlations for single halos: misalignment between
		angular momentum of different particle types
		ang mom and main inertia axes
		ang mom and tidal field eigenvectors
		inertia axes and tv
	as fct of mass, eigenvalues
	
extensions:
	cold/hot gas
	temporal evolution
