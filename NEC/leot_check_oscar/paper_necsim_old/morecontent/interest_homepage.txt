Dark Matter in Dwarfs
=====================

Dwarf spheroidals consist to a large fraction of dark matter. The motion of stars and gas in the potential gives clues to the dynamics of the dark matter.

We analyze simulations of a representative patch of the Universe down to redshift 10, including gas physics modeling. The radial density profiles around density maxima allow comparisons to observed dwarf spheroidals, and help to get insights on the cusp-core problem.

We run dark matter-only simulations as well, and are able to determine the influence of the baryons over the different epochs.
