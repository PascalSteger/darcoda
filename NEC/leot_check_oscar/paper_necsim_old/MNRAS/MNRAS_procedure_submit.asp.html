	<p></p><p>General notes<br>
Monthly Notices publishes original papers on all branches of astronomy
and astrophysics. Authors who submit a paper are expected to be able to
certify that the paper is original work, has not been published before
and is not being considered for publication elsewhere. All published
papers will have been thoroughly peer-reviewed. There are no page
charges, but it is important for papers to be concise: referees may
suggest shortening of any that are not, which may lead to delay. Papers
should be written in grammatical English: authors who have doubts about
this should ask a knowledgeable colleague to read a draft critically.</p> <p><strong>Announcement: Letters section<br></strong>Papers meriting <u>urgent</u>
publication may be published as Letters. They must not exceed five
pages in length, and are handled entirely electronically along a
fast-track process by the Editorial Board, being published rapidly
after acceptance in a separately paginated section of the journal.
Letters appear only in the electronic version of the journal. They are
published online (<a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/</a>)
within 30 days of receipt of the final manuscript files in the
production office, and linked immediately into the NASA ADS. This
enables the fastest possible publication, widest dissemination to the
research community and greatest impact. There are no charges for
authors (no 'page charges'), and electronic publication means that
colour is fully supported, without charge and at the discretion of the
author.</p> <p>Submission of Letters is made online through the ScholarOne Manuscripts system.  See <strong>Section 4</strong> on submission of new manuscripts.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Early View</strong><br>
Monthly Notices is covered by Wiley-Blackwell's Early View service.
Early View articles (both main journal and Letters) are complete
full-text articles published online in advance of their publication in
a printed issue. Articles are therefore available as soon as they are
ready, rather than having to wait for the next scheduled print issue.
Early View articles are complete and final. They have been fully
reviewed, revised and edited for publication, and the authors' final
corrections have been incorporated. Because they are in final form, no
changes can be made after online publication. The nature of Early View
articles means that they do not yet have volume, issue or page numbers,
so Early View articles cannot be cited in the traditional way. They are
therefore given a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which allows the
article to be cited and tracked before it is allocated to an issue.
After print publication, the DOI remains valid and can continue to be
used to cite and access the article. More information about DOIs can be
found at: <a href="http://www.doi.org/">http://www.doi.org</a>.</li> <li><strong>Exclusive Licence Form</strong><br>
Authors will be required to sign an Exclusive Licence Form (ELF) for
all papers accepted for publication. Signature of the ELF is a
condition of publication and papers will not be published unless a
signed form has been received. The form is available for download from
the journal website as a <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/mnr_caf.pdf">PDF</a>
file. Please note that signature of the Exclusive Licence Form does not
affect ownership of copyright in the material. (Government employees
need to complete the Author Warranty sections, although copyright in
such cases does not need to be assigned.) After submission authors will
retain the right to publish their paper in various media/circumstances
(please see the form and <a href="http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/faqs_copyright.asp">http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/faqs_copyright.asp</a>
for further details). Please note that, subject to any third party
consent required, permission need not be sought to reproduce figures in
dissertations or reports which form part of the requirements for
university qualifications, provided that suitable acknowledgement to
the source of the material is made.</li> <li><strong>OnlineOpen<br></strong></li> <li>OnlineOpen
is available to authors of primary research articles who wish to make
their article available to non-subscribers on publication, or whose
funding agency requires grantees to archive the final version of their
article. With OnlineOpen the author, the author's funding agency or the
author's institution pays a fee of £900 to ensure that the article is
made available to non-subscribers upon publication via Wiley
InterScience, as well as deposited in the funding agency's preferred
archive. For the full list of terms and conditions, see <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/authorresources/onlineopen.html#OnlineOpen_Terms"> http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/authorresources/onlineopen.html#OnlineOpen_Terms</a></li> <li>Any authors wishing to send their paper OnlineOpen will be required to complete the payment form available from our website at: <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/MNR_OOF.pdf">http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/MNR_OOF.pdf</a></li> <li>Prior
to acceptance there is no requirement to inform an Editorial Office
that you intend to publish your paper OnlineOpen if you do not wish to.
All OnlineOpen articles are treated in the same way as any other
article. They go through the journal's standard peer-review process and
will be accepted or rejected based on their own merit.<br></li> <li><strong>Changes to papers after acceptance<br></strong>
Monthly Notices aims to publish accepted papers on the Web within 30
days of receipt in the production office. Please appreciate that in
order to achieve this extremely rapid publication, the production
schedule is very tight. If you realize that you need to make changes to
your paper after acceptance, these must be cleared by the RAS first, as
they may need to be referred back to the Editor and/or referee. Please
note that, due to the tight schedule, any post-acceptance changes
notified after the paper has gone into production (i.e. the day after
the acceptance email is sent from the RAS) cannot be incorporated into
the paper before it is typeset. Such changes will therefore need to be
made as part of the proof corrections. To avoid excessive proof
corrections and the delay that these can cause, authors are strongly
encouraged to ensure that each version of their paper that they submit
to MNRAS is completely ready for publication.</li> <li><strong>Author Services<br></strong> Online production tracking is now available for your article through Wiley-Blackwell Author Services.<br>
Author Services enables authors to track their article - once it has
been accepted - through the production process to publication online
and in print. Authors can check the status of their articles online and
choose to receive automated e-mails at key stages of production. The
author will receive an e-mail with a unique link that enables them to
register and have their article automatically added to the system.
Please ensure that a complete e-mail address is provided when
submitting a manuscript. Visit <a href="http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/">http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/</a>
for more details on online production tracking and for a wealth of
resources including FAQs and tips on article preparation, submission
and more.</li> <li>Note for first-time authors<br> The processing of papers has two major, and largely separate, elements - editorial review by the RAS (<strong>Section 4</strong>), and production by Wiley-Blackwell (<strong>Sections 5</strong> and <strong>6</strong>). First-time authors are kindly asked to read these instructions carefully.</li> <li><strong>Newsworthy articles<br></strong>
The RAS Press Officer will be happy to assist with publicity and press
releases in cases where submissions are likely to be of more general
interest. Authors are requested to note in their cover letter if they
feel this is the case.</li> <li>LaTeX documentation for Monthly Notices<br> The LaTeX style and class files can be accessed <a href="http://www.wiley.com/bw/static/mnras_latex.asp">here</a>.</li> <li><strong>Author material archive policy<br></strong> Please note that unless specifically requested, <strong>Wiley-Blackwell will dispose of all hardcopy or electronic material submitted three weeks after publication.</strong>
If you require the return of any material submitted, please inform the
RAS editorial office or production editor as soon as possible.</li> <li><strong>Pre-submission English language editing<br></strong>
Authors for whom English is a second language may choose to have their
manuscript professionally edited before submission to improve the
English. A list of independent suppliers of editing services can be
found at <a href="http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/english_language.asp">http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/english_language.asp</a>. Japanese authors can also find a list of local English improvement services at <a href="http://www.wiley.co.jp/journals/editcontribute.html">http://www.wiley.co.jp/journals/editcontribute.html</a>.
All services are paid for and arranged by the author, and use of one of
these services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for
publication.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>MONTHLY NOTICES of the RAS: INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS</strong></p> <p><u><strong>1. Preparation of manuscripts: general notes</strong></u></p> <p>Authors
are requested to follow the general style of recent issues of Monthly
Notices when preparing their manuscripts. Guidance on specific points
of journal style can be found in <strong>Section 6</strong> of these instructions.</p> <p>Layout of manuscript</p> <p>All pages should be numbered.</p> <p>Title page<br>
The title page should include the title of the paper, and the names and
full postal addresses of each author, along with the address for
correspondence if that is different. E-mail addresses and present
addresses (if different from the institute at which the work was done)
may be included as title page footnotes.</p> <p>Abstract and key words<br> Authors should provide an abstract, normally of not more than 200 words. They should choose up to six key words from the <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/mnraskey.pdf">Monthly Notices key words list</a> - this list is common to MNRAS, ApJ and A&amp;A, and only key words that appear on this list are allowed.</p> <p>Sections<br> The paper should be divided into numbered sections and, if necessary, subsections.</p> <p>Tables and figures<br> A caption should be provided for every table and figure. See <strong>Section 3</strong>
for guidelines on the preparation and supply of artwork. Authors should
notify the RAS when submitting their paper of any special instructions
regarding sizing or layout of figures. Tables and figures must all be
cited in the text of the paper in the correct numerical order.</p> <p>Mathematics<br>
The usual numbering convention for equations [i.e. (1), (2), (3)... or
(2.1), (2.2), (2.3)...] should be followed. Authors should note that
displayed equations in Monthly Notices are ranged left (i.e. no
indent). Papers with numerous or very long equations may be set
single-column instead of the usual double-column format. Authors should
inform the RAS of any special requirements regarding the setting of the
maths, such as the ordering of superscripts and subscripts in tensors,
or the splitting of long equations. See <strong>Section 6</strong> for specific mathematical style points.</p> <p>References<br>
Authors should check carefully that all references in the text appear
in the reference list, and vice versa; also that the dates and spelling
of names are consistent between the text and the reference list. It is
the responsibility of authors to ensure the accuracy of their
references. This is particularly important for the online version of
the journal, where links are provided to cited references. If the
reference details are wrong then the links will fail. Please see <strong>Section 6</strong> for guidance on the style of references in Monthly Notices.</p> <p> </p> <p><u><strong>2. Preparation of manuscripts using TeX, LaTeX or Microsoft Word</strong></u></p> <p>Papers
are typeset, wherever possible, directly from the author's TeX, LaTeX
or Microsoft Word file. TeX/LaTeX is the preferred format because of
the mathematical nature of the material. Monthly Notices has its own
LaTeX class files and TeX macros which simulate the appearance of the
journal page (located <a href="http://www.wiley.com/bw/static/mnras_latex.asp">here</a>), and authors are encouraged to use these, although other class files can also be accepted (see below).</p> <p>The journal class files and macros are also available from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) site <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">http://www.ctan.org</a>. The files are in the directories <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/mnras/">http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/mnras/</a> and <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mnras">http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mnras</a> for TeX and LaTeX respectively. </p> <p>The
LaTeX 2e class file release consists of a readme.txt file, the class
file mn2e.cls, a bibliography style file mn2e.bst for authors wishing
to use BibTeX, and author documentation. The documentation comprises
the author guide to the LaTeX 2e class file, plus a document outlining
the features new to the LaTeX 2e class file. The bibliography style
file is compatible with Patrick Daly's natbib.sty, which is our
recommended cross-referencing package.</p> <p>Authors will need to supply the following files for typesetting (see <strong>Section 4</strong> for submission instructions).</p> <p>(i)
The TeX/LaTeX source code (text, figure captions and tables, preferably
in a single file), along with all other files needed for compiling.
This is particularly important if authors have used any LaTeX style or
class files, bibliography files (.bbl, .bst) or TeX macros apart from
those in the MNRAS release or article.sty/article.cls. If a .bib file
has been used to generate the bibliography in LaTeX, this should be
included along with the .bbl and .tex files. Please do not customize
the MNRAS macros or class file, or redefine macros that are already in
the class file, and please do not include additional definitions unless
they are actually used in the paper. Author-defined macros should be
kept to a minimum.</p> <p>(ii) Electronic graphics files for the illustrations in Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), PDF or TIFF format.</p> <p>We
can usually also accept papers written in Microsoft Word or other word
processing packages, although these are not suitable for papers with a
high mathematical content. [Please note that Word 2007 is not yet
compatible with journal production systems. Unfortunately, MNRAS cannot
accept Microsoft Word 2007 documents until such time as a stable
production version is released. Please therefore use Word's 'Save As'
option to save your document as an older (.doc) file type.]</p> <p>It
is essential that the version of the paper supplied as a TeX, LaTeX or
Microsoft Word file exactly matches the version accepted by the RAS.</p> <p> </p> <p><u><strong>3. Artwork</strong></u></p> <p>Artwork
should be supplied electronically wherever possible. The preferred
format is EPS, although TIFF files can also be used. Technical
guidelines on the supply of <a href="http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/illustration.asp" target="_blank">electronic artwork</a>
are provided. Please consult these when preparing files for
publication. Some hints and tips to help authors supply problem-free
artwork for Monthly Notices are given below, along with common issues
relating to EPS files. </p> <p>Copyright of figures<br> It is the
responsibility of the author to seek and obtain the appropriate
copyright permission for any figures taken from another's work. This
applies not only to photographs, but also to any figure that has been
taken from a previously published article or book. Authors should note
in particular that the copyright for previously published figures may
lie with the publisher of the book or journal in question, not the
author of the article or chapter. It is therefore not usually
sufficient merely to obtain the original author's permission to
reproduce a figure, and prospective Monthly Notices authors may even
have to seek copyright permission for their own figures, if they have
previously been published in a book or journal other than Monthly
Notices. Please refer to the relevant journal or publisher websites for
instructions.</p> <p>Authors are reminded that copyright is a legal
issue: when they sign the Exclusive Licence Form they are stating that
they have not infringed anyone else's copyright with any aspect of
their paper. Monthly Notices will not reproduce a copyrighted figure
without written evidence that the appropriate permission has been
obtained, and any required acknowledgment made.</p> <p>General<br>
Where a figure has several parts, labels (a), (b) etc. should be added
as appropriate. Figures (graphs) containing quantitative information
should have borders on all sides and fiducial marks on every border.</p> <p>Line artwork<br>
Authors are asked to bear in mind, when preparing their diagrams, the
likely reduction that will be needed when the figure is placed in the
journal page. It is important to ensure that the line thickness used
will withstand a possibly significant reduction in size. This applies
to all aspects of the figure, but dotted and dot-dashed lines can cause
particular problems.</p> <p>Line weights must be at least 0.3 pt at
final size; do not use hairlines as these can effectively disappear
(they print at 1/1200th of an inch in thickness) when printed on a
high-resolution imagesetter. Axis labelling, lettering and any plotting
symbols should be sized appropriately for the figure and its likely
final size. For example, a relatively empty figure containing only a
couple of line plots will be reduced to a single journal column (84 mm
wide), and should therefore have thick enough lines and large enough
labelling to withstand reduction perhaps to one-half or one-third of
original size, or even smaller. Labelling that is far too large for a
figure can also be problematic, and may look very odd on the typeset
page. Unsuitable artwork will be referred back to the author,
inevitably leading to delay in publication.</p> <p>Grey-scales and half-tones<br>
Grey-scale images can be tricky to reproduce well, owing to the slight
but unavoidable degradation (loss of contrast) that occurs during the
printing process (which involves wet ink on absorbent paper).</p> <p>Aspects
that cause particular problems include: many shades of grey in a figure
with only subtle differences between them; very fine tints or very
solid tints; large areas of dark grey and black next to each other;
black contours or symbols overlaid on a dark grey background.</p> <p>Steps
that authors can take to remedy these problems and so improve the final
result include: avoiding very fine (80 per cent) tints; increasing the
contrast between shades as much as possible; using fewer different
levels of grey; reversing the grey-scale so that large areas of dark
grey next to black become light grey next to white; making
contours/symbols white where they are overlaid on dark grey shades;
making figures as close to the final size as possible, to minimize the
reduction needed; or even considering whether grey shading is really
needed at all in a figure - e.g. could contours alone be used to
represent the data, or could cross-hatching be used to represent
particular regions of a graph or histogram?</p> <p>Electronic graphics files are essential for a good reproduction of grey-scale figures.</p> <p>Electronic graphics files<br>
The preferred format for electronic graphics file is Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS), although TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files can
also be used.</p> <p>EPS files should be saved with a PC preview/header
to allow viewing on screen, cropped tightly, and saved with a minimum
amount of white space around the illustration. All fonts and any logos
should be embedded as part of the file, and please use a common font
like Times, Arial or Helvetica for labelling. Please also make sure
that all labelling to be included in the figure [e.g. (a), (b), names
of objects in multi-panelled figures, etc.] is embedded in the file -
please do not use LaTeX code to include these labels as the figures are
processed entirely separately from the LaTeX code.</p> <p>Authors
should take care in particular to make sure that the bounding box of
the EPS file encompasses the entire visible area of the image. If the
bounding box is not large enough, the figure will appear cropped when
imported into the typesetter's software (Adobe Photoshop or Adobe
Illustrator). Ideally, the EPS file should be scaled to the final size
and have the desired aspect ratio. Do not alter the aspect ratio using
LaTeX code as the files are dealt with separately from the LaTeX file.
Also please note that the typesetters cannot use graphics that have
been produced using the LaTeX picture environment.</p> <p>TIFF files
should be saved with a minimum amount of white space around the
illustration, and with the PC option if possible. Please make sure that
the TIFF file has sufficient resolution: this is 300 pixels per inch
(ppi) for grey-scale/half-tone figures (e.g. photographs), and 800 ppi
for combined line/tone figures, at final size.</p> <p>For example, a
figure that is to fill one column (approx. 80 mm wide, or 3.15 inches)
needs to be at least 945 pixels wide if it is a photograph (3.15 × 300)
or 2500 pixels wide (3.15 × 800) if it is a combination of a photograph
and labelling. If the file is very large then it can be compressed:
please tell us which compression method has been used.</p> <p>Graphics
files should be named to indicate clearly to which illustration they
pertain (e.g. fig6.eps for Fig. 6). Please do not supply figures with
long, complicated filenames. Please supply the figures as one figure
per file and not as multi-page PS or TIFF files.</p> <p>For all
graphics files please make sure that the line weight is acceptable -
the weight should not be less than 0.3 pt at final size. Finer lines
and points than this will not print, even if you can see them on your
laser printed hard copy - bear in mind that your laser printer has a
far lower resolution than the imagesetter that will be used at the
journal printers. When selecting line styles avoid triple-dot-dashed
lines as this line style is overly complicated and is not always
supported by typesetting, PostScripting and artwork software. Solid,
dotted, dashed, dot-dashed, double-dot-dashed and dot-double-dashed
lines are all OK.</p> <p>Colour illustrations<br> Colour artwork can be
accepted for publication, but authors will be charged for the extra
cost involved, unless the use of colour is considered by the Editor to
be essential to the paper. The cost of colour printing is £105 + VAT,
which entitles the author to publish as many colour figures as they
want within their paper. Authors who are paying for the colour in their
paper are required to complete and return a colour work agreement form
before their paper can be processed. The form can be downloaded as a
PDF file from <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/mnr_form.pdf">http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/mnr_form.pdf</a>
and must be returned to the MNRAS Journal Production team at
Wiley-Blackwell, 101 George Street, Edinburgh EH2 3ES (Fax: +44 131 226
3803). If you are unable to download the form, please contact the
production team. (To read PDF files, you must have Acrobat Reader
installed on your computer. If you do not have this program, it is
available as a free download from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html</a>) <em>Papers will not be published until the colour work agreement form is returned.</em></p> <p>Electronic graphics files should be supplied as CMYK if possible, rather than RGB.</p> <p>Please
note that it may not always be possible to get an exact match for all
of the colours in a particular figure: in particular, colours that
appear fluorescent on-screen will look flatter when printed. The exact
appearance of a colour figure at any stage depends on the display
medium and settings used: e.g. EPS file viewed on screen, laser print,
CMYK printing of ink on paper. Authors hoping to include colour in
their paper should discuss it with the RAS as early as possible in the
submission process.</p> <p>Any colour files not printed in colour will
be published as grey-scale in the paper journal and in colour on the
web, free of charge. If you have figures that are to be processed in
this way, please check the proofs very carefully, as false colours can
sometimes reproduce in unusual ways when converted to grey-scale mode.
If you wish, you can supply separate grey-scale and colour files for
the print and web versions of your paper.</p> <p>Tables<br> Tables
should be included as part of the TeX, LaTeX or Microsoft Word file.
Please avoid the use of rules in tables, except for horizontal rules at
the head and foot, and under the column headings. Authors should bear
in mind that, for tables that run over several pages, the original page
breaks of the table may not necessarily be retained in the proofs. If
for some reason it is important to retain the original table page
breaks, this should be clearly indicated to the RAS when the paper is
submitted.</p> <p>If a paper contains lengthy data tables, it is often
not appropriate to publish them in the printed journal, for reasons of
space. Such tabular material will be published alongside the electronic
version of the article, on Wiley Interscience. A small sample of each
data table should be included in the main paper. Authors planning to
submit papers including such tabular material should make their
intentions clear to the RAS when submitting their papers. They should
also be prepared to include small sample tables in the text, and to
provide PostScript, PDF or plain text files of the full tables with the
final version of their accepted paper, for use in the electronic issue.
The full guidelines for online-only material can be found here: <a href="http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/suppmat.asp">http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/suppmat.asp</a>.</p> <p>Authors
may also, if they wish, mount machine-readable versions of their tables
on the VizieR data base of astronomical catalogues at the Centre de
Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) web site. It is the
responsibility of the author to mount such material on CDS, and to
ensure that it is in the correct format for the data base. Details of
the VizieR data base, as well as guidelines on formatting and
submission of data, can be found at the CDS web site (<a href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/</a>). A hyperlink can be included to CDS from the electronic text of the Monthly Notices article.</p> <p> </p> <p><u><strong>4. Electronic submission of manuscripts to Monthly Notices and Monthly Notices Letters via ScholarOne Manuscripts.</strong></u></p> <p>Electronic
submission of new manuscripts to Monthly Notices and Monthly Notices
Letters must now be made via the ScholarOne Manuscripts (formerly known
as Manuscript Central) submission and tracking system (<a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mnras">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mnras</a>).
Note that revised versions of manuscripts originally submitted to the
RAS ftp server (i.e. pre-2006) should still be sent by ftp as
previously instructed, with an email detailing the changes to the
Editorial Assistant concerned.</p> <p><strong>File requirements</strong></p> <p>You
should be prepared to submit your manuscript as a single file
containing all figures and tables, in PDF, PS, Word, RTF or plain text
format. Please submit in the single spaced format so that the length of
the paper may be judged. The ScholarOne Manuscripts system is able to
convert any of these to a single PDF for use by the editor and
reviewers. Do not zip this file. ScholarOne Manuscripts cannot convert
LaTeX files to PDF. Please keep PDFs as small as possible and in any
case not bigger than 10 MB without prior approval, for the review stage.</p> <p>You
must also upload your LaTeX and EPS source files, designating them as
files 'not for review'. These will be used for typesetting purposes and
must be uploaded with each version of your paper, i.e. original version
and all revisions. A single .tar or .zip file containing all of your
source files and a readme file should be uploaded. If you have used a
.bib file to generate your bibliography in LaTeX, please do include
this in your .tar/.zip archive along with the .bbl and .tex files; this
will aid the typesetting process.</p> <p>You may also upload
supplementary material which is not intended for publication, such as
additional data, figures etc. This should be designated as
'supplementary material' and will be added to the PDF made by the
system, making it available to the editor and reviewer.</p> <p><strong>Submitting a manuscript</strong></p> <p>Login at <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mnras">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mnras</a>.
Note that your USER ID and Password are case sensitive. You may check
whether you already have an account, or find your user ID and password
by entering your e-mail address into the 'Password Help' section. If
necessary, create a new account. The Main Menu page will open and you
should click on the 'Author Centre' button.</p> <p>Click on 'Submit a
Manuscript' on the top toolbar, or on the blue star icon. There are
seven steps to complete when submitting a paper. These are listed down
the left hand side of the screen. Some information, such as your name
as author, is added automatically. A green tick appears next to each
step as it is completed. </p> <p>The steps do not have to be completed
in sequence and the process can be abandoned mid-way through and picked
up again at a later session, the information being stored as an
'unsubmitted manuscript'. If later you choose to continue with the
submission, you should click on 'Unsubmitted manuscripts' in your
'Author Centre'. The paper will appear in a table and you should then
click on 'Continue submission'.</p> <p>You must complete all stages for
successful submission. Compulsory fields are marked with a purple
'req'. Do not use your browser's 'forward' or 'back' buttons, but move
through the stages either by clicking on the step numbers on the left
hand side of the page or by using the system's 'next' and 'previous'
buttons.</p> <p><em>Step 1</em> - Enter your manuscript type, title and
abstract. If you are submitting a revised version and have made changes
to any of these, be certain to update the manuscript type and title
information or upload a new abstract.</p> <p><em>Step 2</em> - Choose at least one and up to six key words from the list provided.</p> <p><em>Step 3</em>
- List your co-authors. You are automatically added as first author.
Additional authors may be added and the order changed using the order
drop-down box in the first column of the table. Listing the entire
author list is not compulsory. If your co-authors do not have accounts
on ScholarOne Manuscripts, one will automatically be created for each
and they will be notified by email. This will enable them to track the
progress of the manuscript via ScholarOne Manuscripts.</p> <p><em>Step 4</em> - Here you may list non-preferred reviewers and preferred/non-preferred editors.  This is optional.</p> <p><em>Step 5</em>
- Add your cover letter. Please be sure to flag up any figures that you
would like to be printed in colour (so that these can be evaluated by
the Editor), any online-only material (e.g. long data tables; see
guidelines <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/bauthor/suppmat.asp">here</a>), any special instructions or anything else unusual about the paper.</p> <p><em>Step 6</em> - Upload your files here (.ps, .pdf, .doc, .eps etc.).  Give each file a designation from the drop down list. </p> <p>One
file should be your complete manuscript and designated as such.
Supplementary material, such as related figures or tables, not intended
for publication but intended to be viewed by the editor and reviewer,
may also be uploaded here and designated as 'supplementary materials'.
This too will be combined with your other files in the PDF produced by
the system.</p> <p>Your LaTeX and EPS source files must also be
uploaded and should be designated as files 'not for review'. The
content of the manuscript in these files must be identical to the files
that you supply for review, otherwise delays in publication will occur.
When submitting a revised version, be certain to delete the files
uploaded for previous versions and upload your new files!<br>  <br>
Click 'Upload Files' at the bottom of the screen. All files, except
those designated 'not for review', will be combined into a single PDF
file.</p> <p><em>Step 7</em> - Here you will see a checklist of what
you have entered. Before you can complete your submission, you must
proof read your PDF 'proofs'.<br> Submission can then be completed by
clicking the 'submit' icon. Check your 'proofs' carefully! These are
the files that the editor and reviewer will receive.</p> <p>You will
receive confirmation onscreen and in a separate email. Keep a note of
your Manuscript ID; this will help you track your submission via
ScholarOne Manuscripts. The Editorial Office will contact you as soon
as a decision has been made.</p> <p>In case of any difficulties during submission, please contact the Editorial Office Manager, Kim Clube at <a href="mailto:kc@ras.org.uk">kc@ras.org.uk</a>.<br></p> <p> </p> <p><u><strong>5. The publication process after a paper has been accepted</strong></u></p> <p>When
a paper has been accepted for publication, it will be forwarded by the
RAS to the publishers, Wiley-Blackwell. The paper will then be
copy-edited and typeset from the supplied electronic files and authors
will be receive an e-mail alert for them to download a PDF file of
their proofs. The PDF proofs will contain queries regarding
ambiguities, unclear sections of text, missing information, etc. You
must return a completed Exclusive Licence Form with your proof
corrections if you have not already done so.</p> <p>Note that although
the paper will be typeset using the author's source files as a starting
point, the paper will have been converted to XML in the typesetter's
own system and the PDF proofs created from this. Therefore, proofs
should be read carefully, particularly equations and other numerical
matter. It is the responsibility of each author to check his or her
proofs, reply to any queries, and notify the production team of any
typographical errors. When updating the reference list, please be
careful to update textual citations as well if the year has changed.
Proofs should be returned by the date requested if at all possible -
delay in returning the proofs will lead to delay in publication of the
paper. Authors should keep their own alterations to a minimum - it may
be necessary to charge authors for excessive alterations for which they
are responsible. We only want authors to make essential changes once
the paper is in proof form. If it is suspected that extensive proof
changes may alter the science in any significant way, the paper will be
put on hold and referred back to the RAS for approval. Please do not
send a new LaTeX source file for your paper at proof correction stage,
as we will be unable to use it. Short LaTeX excerpts for mathematical
corrections are acceptable.</p> <p>Authors should note that papers are
published in Early View rapidly after receipt of author proof
corrections, and that once an article has appeared online, <u>no further changes will be permitted</u>,
even to correct errors. Authors should therefore make sure that they
check their proofs extremely carefully, and they should regard the
proof corrections they send back as the <u>complete and final</u> corrections for the paper.</p> <p>Authors
may if they wish make reference in their proofs to new and related work
by others, or additional material that is relevant to their paper but
does not change the scientific content, by inserting a 'Note added in
proof' at the end of the paper, just before the references.</p> <p>Offprints<br>
Authors will be provided with a PDF offprint on publication of their
paper. These are provided free of charge to the corresponding author,
and may be distributed subject to the accompanying terms and conditions.</p> <p>For
main journal articles, paper offprints of the published article may be
purchased if ordered via the method stipulated on the instructions that
accompany the proofs. Note that it is not uncommon for printed
offprints to take up to eight weeks to arrive after publication of the
journal.</p> <p> </p> <p><u><strong>6. Monthly Notices journal style</strong></u></p> <p>Authors
submitting papers to Monthly Notices may find it useful to note the
following points regarding journal style. The notes given here relate
to common style points found in Monthly Notices manuscripts, and are
not intended to be exhaustive. Please see any recent issue of the
journal for more details.</p> <p>Titles and section/subsection headings<br>
Sections should be numbered 1, 2, 2.1, 2.1.1 etc. Appendices should be
labelled A, B, etc. With the exception of main section headings (e.g.
INTRODUCTION), capital letters should be used only where they would
occur in a normal sentence - e.g. <i>ROSAT</i> observations of the unusual star..., not <i>ROSAT</i> Observations of the Unusual Star....</p> <p>Key words<br> Here is the list of <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pdf/mnraskey.pdf">Monthly Notices key words</a>
(updated 2009 December). No other key words should be used. Up to six
key words are allowed for each paper, and they are used in the
preparation of the volume and end of year indexes. Please use the
correct layout for key words, e.g.</p> <p>Key words: galaxies: active - galaxies: Seyfert - radio continuum: galaxies.</p> <p>Punctuation<br>
When deciding where to add commas, it may be helpful to read through
the sentence and note where the natural pauses occur. The needs of
readers for whom English is not a first language should be borne in
mind when punctuating long sentences. For example, consider the
following sentence as it appeared in Monthly Notices: When we do not
limit ourselves by constraints arising from the choice of an initial
fluctuation spectrum, structures in an open universe, including the
peculiar velocity structure, can be reproduced in a flat Lemaître
universe for a large part of their evolution.</p> <p>Now consider the
same sentence without commas: When we do not limit ourselves by
constraints arising from the choice of an initial fluctuation spectrum
structures in an open universe including the peculiar velocity
structure can be reproduced in a flat Lemaître universe for a large
part of their evolution.</p> <p>Spelling<br> Please use British spelling - e.g. centre not center, labelled not labeled.</p> <p>The
following style regarding -ise/yse and -ize spellings is followed.
-ise/yse: devise, surprise, comprise, revise, exercise, analyse. -ize:
recognize, criticize, minimize, emphasize, organize, parametrize (note
the spelling of this word in particular).</p> <p>Miscellaneous journal
spellings: acknowledgments, artefact, best-fitting (not best-fit), disc
(except computer disk), haloes (not halos), hotspot, none the less,
non-linear, on to, time-scale.</p> <p>none is a singular word (none of the stars is a white dwarf); data is a plural word (these data show...).</p> <p>Hyphens and N-rules<br>
Hyphens (one dash in TeX/LaTeX): Monthly Notices uses hyphens for
compound adjectives (e.g. low-density gas, least-squares fit,
two-component model). This also applies to simple units (e.g. 1.5-m
telescope, 284.5-nm line), but not to complex units or ranges, which
could become cumbersome (e.g. 15 km s-1 feature, 100-200 µm
observations). Some words (e.g. time-scale) are always hyphenated as
part of journal style (see above).</p> <p>N-rules (two dashes in
TeX/LaTeX): these are used (i) to separate key words, (ii) as
parentheses (e.g. the results - assuming no temperature gradient - are
indicative of ...), (iii) to denote a range (e.g. 1.6-2.2 µm), and (iv)
to denote the joining of two words (e.g. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
Herbig-Haro object).</p> <p>The M-rule (three dashes in TeX/LaTeX) is not used in Monthly Notices.</p> <p>References<br> <i>In the text</i><br> When citing references in the text, tables or figure captions:</p> <ul> <li>for one author, use the style (Brown 1999) or e.g. ...the observations of Brown (1999)... , depending on the context;</li> <li>for two authors, use an ampersand: Brown &amp; Jones (1991);</li> <li>for
three authors, give all three names at first mention, e.g. (Brown,
Jones &amp; Smith 1994), but et al. (in roman) thereafter, e.g. (Brown
et al. 1994);</li> <li>for more than three authors, use et al.;</li> <li>for several papers by the same author(s), use the style (Brown 1992, 1995) or Smith et al. (2000a,b) show that...;</li> <li>when
several papers are listed in brackets, they should be ordered by date
and separated by semi-colons, e.g. (Smith et al. 1990; Brown et al.
1995).</li> </ul> <p><i>In the references list</i><br> Use no bold or
italic, no commas after author surnames, and no ampersand between the
final two author names. List all authors if eight or fewer, otherwise
first three authors only followed by `et al.'. The styles for journal
articles, conferences, books and PhD theses are illustrated below.</p> <p>Eke V., Cole S., Frenk C.S., 1996, MNRAS, 282, 263</p> <p>Smith

(no arrows); matrices are bold Univers font (like bold sans serif); dot
products are denoted by a bold centred dot, cross-products by a bold
multiplication sign. Differential d, complex i, exponential e, sin,
cos, tan, log, etc., are roman. Sub/superscripts that are physical
variables are italic, while those that are just labels are roman (e.g. <i>Ct</i>, but <i>T</i>eff).
Equations should be punctuated as part of the sentence. Displayed
equations are ranged left (i.e. no indent). Numbering of equations
should follow the convention (1), (2)... or (2.1), (2.2)... . Equations
in appendices should be numbered (A1), (A2), (B1), etc.</p> <p>Units<br> Units should be in roman and separated from the number by a space - e.g. 200 keV.<br> The units of time are ms, s, min, h, d, yr.<br>
The units of length/distance are Å, nm, µm, mm, cm, m, km, au,
light-year, pc. Use superscript -1, not solidus /, for units: e.g.<br>
km s-1 not km/s. The unit of arcseconds is arcsec when used to denote
angular size or separation (e.g. beamsize 12 arcsec, 30 arcsec west of
the star); use ' for coordinates (e.g. Dec. -30o 29 23') (similarly for
arcmin).<br> Avoid repeating units unnecessarily (e.g. 1.3 and 2.6 mm rather than 1.3 mm and 2.6 mm).<br> The unit of magnitudes is mag, not superscript m.<br> Percentages should be written per cent, not %.<br> Use the degree symbol o except to denote e.g. areas, where deg2 may be more appropriate (e.g. a survey area of 3 deg2).<br> Solar masses and solar luminosities should be roman.</p> <p>Miscellaneous<br> e.g., i.e., cf., etc., are roman.<br> Single quotes not double quotes.<br> Letters denoting wavebands (e.g. <i>UBV</i>) are set italic. Colour excess is set as e.g. <em>E(B-V</em>) (minus sign).<br> Letters denoting orbital states are set roman.<br> Ionized species should be denoted by small capitals, preceded by a thin space - e.g. He I.<br> Balmer lines are set as e.g. H (no subscript).<br> Computer software (e.g. CLOUDY) should be in small capitals.<br> Satellite names should be in italic (e.g. <i>Ginga, IRAS</i>).<br> The correct bracket order is {[( )]}.<br> Acronyms and abbreviations should be spelt out at the first occurrence, unless they are very well known.<br>
Dates should be written as e.g. 1998 April 14, except in tables, where
the standard abbreviations (IAU Style Manual, table 8) can be used.<br>
Figures and tables should be referred to as e.g. Fig. 1 and Table 1,
unless they are from another paper, in which case fig. 1 and table 1
should be used.</p> <p>In resolutions passed by the 20th General
Assembly of the IAU, authors are urged: (i) to use only standard SI
units and those additional units that are recognized for use in
astronomy; and (ii) to ensure that all astronomical objects referred to
in the literature are designated clearly and unambiguously in
