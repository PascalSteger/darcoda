[ ] give basic scales

[ ] picture/equations on screen, notes on laptop
[ ] list of slides, jump to by number

[ ] laser pointer visible and not too bright
[ ] use laser pointer only to indicate motions
[ ] no more than 3 equations per slide
[ ] use more slides quicker to hinder loss of overview

[ ] stand freely, walk a little, use hands, keep quiet
[ ] free thoughts after presentation, reformulate questions
[ ] explain every term in a formula
[ ] explain what errors indicate, where they come from
[ ] do not show anything you don't want to explain
[ ] preliminary: no one believes anything, you have to convince them
[ ] technical details where method is really important and new thing,
    basic concepts elsewhere
[ ] show method ready for future techniques, observations
[ ] if asked for old methods, check relevance (do they apply in current physical space of interest?)
