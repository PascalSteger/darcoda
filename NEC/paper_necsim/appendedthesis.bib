  abstract =     {We have reviewed the chemistry and cooling behavior
                  of low-density (n <~ 10^4 cm^-3) primordial gas and
                  devised a model which involves 19 collisional and 9
                  radiative processes and is applicable for
                  temperatures in the range 1 K < T < 10^8 K. In a
                  companion paper (Anninos et al., 1997)[NewA, 2, 209]
                  numerical methods are presented that unify the
                  modeling of non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry
                  and cooling dicussed here with cosmological
                  hydrodynamics. We derived new fits of rate
                  coefficients for the photo-attachment of neutral
                  hydrogen, the formation of molecular hydrogen via
                  H^-, charge exchange between H_2 and H^+, electron
                  detachment of H^- by neutral hydrogen, dissociative
                  recombination of H_2^+ with slow electrons,
                  photodissociation of H_2^+, and photodissociation of
                  H_2. Furthermore it was found that the molecular
                  hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes,
                  H_2^+ + H --> H_2 + H^+, and H^- + H --> H_2 + e^-,
                  is likely to be converted into its para
                  configuration on a faster time scale than the
                  formation time. We have tested the model extensively
                  and shown it to agree well with former studies. We
                  further studied the chemical kinetics in great
                  detail and devised a minimal model which is
                  substantially simpler than the full reaction network
                  but predicts correct abundances.  This minimal model
                  shows convincingly that 12 collisional processes are
                  sufficient to model the H, He, H^+, H^-, He^+,
                  He^++, and H_2 abundances in low density primordial
                  gas for applications with no radiation fields.},

  abstract =     {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the
                  Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this data release,
                  the imaging of the northern Galactic cap is now
                  complete. The survey contains images and parameters
                  of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2,
                  including scans over a large range of Galactic
                  latitudes and longitudes. The survey also includes
                  1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars,
                  and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over
                  7425 deg2 . This release includes much more stellar
                  spectroscopy than was available in previous data
                  releases and also includes detailed estimates of
                  stellar temperatures, gravities, and
                  metallicities. The results of improved photometric
                  calibration are now available, with uncertainties of
                  roughly 1 percent in g, r, i, and z, and 2 percent in u,
                  substantially better than the uncertainties in
                  previous data releases. The spectra in this data
                  release have improved wavelength and flux
                  calibration, especially in the extreme blue and
                  extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better
                  determination of stellar types and radial
                  velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes are now
                  tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars
                  rather than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust
                  results in the presence of seeing variations, but
                  also implies a change in the spectrophotometric
                  scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35
                  mag. Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions
                  of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two
                  independent codes for determining spectral
                  classifications and redshifts are made
                  available. Additional spectral outputs are made
                  available, including calibrated spectra from
                  individual 15 minute exposures and the sky spectrum
                  subtracted from each exposure. We also quantify a
                  recently recognized underestimation of the
                  brightnesses of galaxies of large angular extent due
                  to poor sky subtraction; the bias can exceed 0.2 mag
                  for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

  abstract =     {The virial theorem prescribes the ratio of the
                  globally-averaged equatorial to vertical velocity
                  dispersion of a tracer population in spherical and
                  flattened dark haloes. This gives sequences of
                  physical models in the plane of global anisotropy
                  and flattening. The tracer may have any density,
                  though there are particularly simple results for
                  power-laws and exponentials. We prove the flattening
                  theorem: for a spheroidally stratified tracer
                  density with axis ratio q in a dark density
                  potential with axis ratio g, the ratio of globally
                  averaged equatorial to vertical velocity dispersion
                  depends only on q/g. As the stellar halo density and
                  velocity dispersion of the Milky Way are accessible
                  to observations, this provides a new method for
                  measuring the flattening of the dark matter. If the
                  kinematics of the local halo subdwarfs are
                  representative, then the Milky Way's dark halo is
                  oblate with a flattening in the potential of g
                  0.85, corresponding to a flattening in the dark
                  matter density of ~ 0.7. The fractional pressure
                  excess for power-law populations is roughly
                  proportional to both the ellipticity and the
                  fall-off exponent. Given the same pressure excess,
                  if the density profile of one stellar population
                  declines more quickly than that of another, then it
                  must be rounder.  This implies that the dual halo
                  structure claimed by Carollo et al.  (2007) for the
                  Galaxy, a flatter inner halo and a rounder outer
                  halo, is inconsistent with the virial theorem. For
                  the thick disc, we provide formulae for the virial
                  sequences of double-exponential discs in logarithmic
                  and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) haloes. There are good
                  matches to the observational data on the flattening
                  and anisotropy of the thick disc if the thin disc is
                  exponential with a short scalelength ~ 2.6 kpc and
                  normalisation of 56 solar masses per square parsec,
                  together with a logarithmic dark halo.},

  abstract =     {Context. According to the current cosmological
                  paradigm, large scale structures form hierarchically
                  in the Universe. Clusters of galaxies grow through a
                  continuous accretion of mass, and the presence of
                  cluster substructures can be interpreted as
                  signature of this process.  Nevertheless, the rate
                  and manner of mass accretion events are still
                  matters of debate.  Aims: We have analysed the
                  presence of substructures in one of the largest
                  sample of nearby cluster galaxies available in the
                  literature.  We have determined the fraction of
                  clusters with substructure and the properties of the
                  galaxies located in such substructures.  Methods:
                  Substructure in the galaxy clusters was studied
                  using the Dressler-Shectman test, which was
                  calibrated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations
                  of galaxy clusters similar to real ones. In order to
                  avoid possible biases in the results due to
                  differing incompleteness among clusters, we selected
                  two galaxy populations: a) galaxies brighter than Mr
                  = -20 located in clusters at z < 0.1 (EC1); and b)
                  galaxies of brightness Mr < -19 located at z < 0.07
                  (EC2).  Results: In the inner cluster regions (r <
                  r200) 11 and 33percent of the clusters of EC1 and EC2
                  respectively show substructure. This fraction is
                  larger in the outer cluster regions (55percent) for EC1
                  and EC2 samples.  Cluster global properties, such as
                  σ_c, fb or Δ m12 do not depend on the amount of
                  cluster substructure. We have studied the properties
                  of individual galaxies located in substructures in
                  the EC1 and EC2 galaxy populations. The fraction of
                  galaxies within substructures is larger in the outer
                  cluster regions when fainter galaxies are
                  included. The distribution of relative velocities of
                  galaxies within substructures suggest that they
                  consist of an infalling population mixed with
                  backsplash galaxies. We can not rule out that the
                  infalling galaxy population located in substructures
                  are genuine field ones.},

                  Sky Survey to investigate the orientations of 4289
                  satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts. The
                  orientation of the satellites is inconsistent with a
                  random distribution at the 99.94 percennt confidence
                  level, and the satellites show a preference for
                  elongation in the direction of their hosts. Further,
                  on scales <50 kpc the major axes of the host
                  galaxies and their satellites are preferentially
                  aligned. Phrased in the terminology of weak lensing,
                  the images of the satellites have a mean shear of
                  γT=-0.045+/-0.010, averaged over scales 10
                  kpc<=rP<=50 kpc. In a galaxy-galaxy lensing study in
                  which lenses and sources are separated solely on the
                  basis of apparent magnitude, we estimate that on
                  scales <~250 kpc satellite galaxies account for
                  between 10 and 15 percent of the objects that are
                  identified as sources. In such studies, elongation
                  of the satellites will cause a reduction of the
                  galaxy-galaxy lensing shear by of order 25-40
                  percent. Hence, the elongation of satellite galaxies
                  in the direction of their hosts is a potentially
                  important effect for precision studies of
                  galaxy-galaxy lensing and argues strongly in favor
                  of the use of accurate photometric redshifts in
                  order to identify lenses and sources in future
                  studies.},

  abstract =     {We present a 9 million star color-magnitude diagram
                  (9M CMD) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
                  bar. The 9M CMD reveals a complex superposition of
                  different-age and -metallicity stellar populations,
                  with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring
                  over 3 orders of magnitude in number density. First,
                  we count the nonvariable red and blue supergiants
                  and the associated Cepheid variables and measure the
                  stellar effective temperatures defining the Cepheid
                  instability strip. Lifetime predictions of stellar
                  evolution theory are tested, with implications for
                  the origin of low-luminosity Cepheids. The highly
                  evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the
                  9M CMD have a bimodal distribution in brightness,
                  which we interpret as discrete old populations (>~1
                  Gyr). The faint AGB sequence may be metal-poor and
                  very old. Comparing the mean properties of giant
                  branch and horizontal-branch (HB) stars in the 9M
                  CMD with those of clusters, we identify NGC 411 and
                  M3 as templates for the admixture of old stellar
                  populations in the bar. However, there are several
                  indications that the old and metal-poor field
                  population has a red HB morphology: the RR Lyrae
                  variables lie preferentially on the red edge of the
                  instability strip, the AGB bump is very red, and the
                  ratio of AGB bump stars to RR Lyrae variables is
                  quite large. If the HB second parameter is age, the
                  old and metal-poor field population in the bar
                  likely formed after the oldest LMC
                  clusters. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution
                  theory lead us to associate a significant fraction
                  of the ~1 million red HB clump giants in the 9M CMD
                  with the same old and metal-poor population
                  producing the RR Lyrae stars and the AGB bump. In
                  this case, compared with the age-dependent
                  luminosity predictions of stellar evolution theory,
                  the red HB clump is too bright relative to the RR
                  Lyrae stars and AGB bump. Last, we show that the
                  surface density profile of RR Lyrae variables is
                  fitted by an exponential, favoring a disklike rather
                  than a spheroidal distribution. We conclude that the
                  age of the LMC disk is probably similar to the age
                  of the Galactic disk.},

  abstract =     {Alignments of galaxy clusters (the Binggeli effect),
                  as well as of galaxies themselves have long been
                  studied both observationally and
                  theoretically. Here, we test the influence of
                  large-scale structures and tidal fields on the
                  shapes and alignments of cluster-size and
                  galaxy-size dark matter haloes. We use a
                  high-resolution N-body simulation of a Λ cold dark
                  matter (ΛCDM) universe, together with the results of
                  Colberg, Krughoff & Connolly, who identified
                  filaments connecting pairs of clusters. We find that
                  cluster pairs connected by a filament are strongly
                  aligned with the cluster-cluster axis, whereas
                  unconnected ones are not. For smaller, galaxy-size
                  haloes, there also is an alignment signal, but its
                  strength is independent of whether the halo is part
                  of an obvious large-scale structure. Additionally,
                  we find no measurable dependence of galaxy halo
                  shape on membership of a filament. We also quantify
                  the influence of tidal fields and find that these do
                  correlate strongly with alignments of haloes. The
                  alignments of most haloes are thus caused by tidal
                  fields, with cluster-size haloes being strongly
                  aligned through the added mechanism of infall of
                  matter from filaments.},

  abstract =     {A number of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are
                  known to contain a more extended, metal-poor
                  population with a flattish velocity dispersion
                  profile, and a more concentrated, metal-rich
                  population with a velocity dispersion declining with
                  radius. The two populations can be modelled with
                  Michie-King distribution functions (DFs) in the
                  isothermal and in the sharply truncated limits,
                  respectively. We argue that the truncation of the
                  metal-rich population can be traced back to the
                  spatial distribution of the star-forming
                  gas. Suppose δ is the exponent of the first
                  non-constant term in the Taylor expansion of the
                  total potential at the centre (δ= 1 for
                  Navarro-Frenk-White or NFW haloes, δ= 2 for cored
                  haloes). Then, we show that the ratio of the
                  half-light radii of the populations Rδ/2h, 2/Rh,
                  1δ/2 must be smaller than the ratio of the
                  line-of-sight velocity dispersions σlos, 2(Rh,
                  2)/σlos, 1(Rh, 1).  Specializing to the case of the
                  Sculptor dSph, we develop a technique to fit
                  simultaneously both populations with Michie-King
                  DFs. This enables us to determine the mass profile
                  of the Sculptor dSph with unprecedented accuracy in
                  the radial range 0.2 < r < 1.2 kpc. We show that
                  cored halo models are preferred over cusped halo
                  models, with a likelihood ratio test rejecting NFW
                  models at any significance level higher than 0.05
                  per cent. Even more worryingly, the best-fitting NFW
                  models require concentrations with c ≲ 20, which is
                  not in the cosmologically preferred range for dwarf
                  galaxies. We conclude that the kinematics of
                  multiple populations in dSphs provides a substantial
                  new challenge for theories of galaxy formation, with
                  the weight of available evidence strongly against
                  dark matter cusps at the centre.},

                  be efficient for three-dimensional calculations
                  without sacrificing accuracy. In all, 28 kinetic
                  reactions are solved including both collisional and
                  radiative processes for the following nine separate
                  species: H, H^+, He, He^+, He^++, H^-, H_2^+, H_2,
                  and e^-. The method identifies those reactions
                  (involving H^- and H_2^+) occurring on the shortest
                  time scales, decoupling them from the rest of the
                  network and imposing equilibrium concentrations to
                  good accuracy over typical cosmological dynamical
                  times. Several tests of our code are presented,
                  including radiative shock waves, cosmological
                  sheets, conservation constraints, and fully
                  three-dimensional simulations of CDM cosmological
                  evolutions in which we compare our method to results

  abstract =     {We analyse the structure and connectivity of the
                  distinct morphologies that define the cosmic
                  web. With the help of our multiscale morphology
                  filter (MMF), we dissect the matter distribution of
                  a cosmological λ cold dark matter N-body computer
                  simulation into cluster, filaments and walls. The
                  MMF is ideally suited to address both the
                  anisotropic morphological character of filaments and
                  sheets, and the multiscale nature of the
                  hierarchically evolved cosmic matter distribution.
                  The results of our study may be summarized as
                  follows. (i) While all morphologies occupy a roughly
                  well-defined range in density, this alone is not
                  sufficient to differentiate between them given their
                  overlap. Environment defined only in terms of
                  density fails to incorporate the intrinsic dynamics
                  of each morphology. This plays an important role in
                  both linear and non-linear interactions between
                  haloes. (ii) Most of the mass in the Universe is
                  concentrated in filaments, narrowly followed by
                  clusters. In terms of volume, clusters only
                  represent a minute fraction and filaments not more
                  than 9 per cent. Walls are relatively inconspicuous
                  in terms of mass and volume.  (iii) On average,
                  massive clusters are connected to more filaments
                  than low-mass clusters. Clusters with M
                  1014Msolarh-1 have on average two connecting
                  filaments, while clusters with M >= 1015Msolarh-1
                  have on average five connecting filaments. (iv)
                  Density profiles indicate that the typical width of
                  filaments is 2h-1Mpc. Walls have less well-defined
                  boundaries with widths between 5 and 8Mpc h-1.  In
                  their interior, filaments have a power-law density
                  profile with slope γ ~ -1, corresponding to an
                  isothermal density profile.},

                  conditions and two in which the initial conditions
                  have more power on large scales, as predicted in
                  models with cold dark matter (CDM). Statistical
                  analysis of large catalogs of objects shows that the
                  dimensionless spin parameter λ is remarkably
                  insensitive to the initial perturbation spectrum and
                  has a median value λme≡ 0.05. The quantity λ is

                  substructure and is uncorrelated with initial

                  dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The accurate velocities
                  (+/-2 km s-1) and large area coverage of Scl allow

                  out of reach.  Still, one can start from a set of
                  axioms that describe the most desirable properties a
                  cosmological constant should have. This can be seen
                  in certain analogy to the Khinchin axioms in
                  information theory, which fix the most desirable
                  properties an information measure should have and
                  that ultimately lead to the Shannon entropy as the
                  fundamental information measure on which statistical
                  mechanics is based. Here we formulate a set of
                  axioms for the cosmological constant in close
                  analogy to the Khinchin axioms, formally replacing
                  the dependence of the information measure on
                  probabilities of events by a dependence of the
                  cosmological constant on the fundamental constants
                  of nature.  Evaluating this set of axioms one
                  finally arrives at a formula for the cosmological
                  constant given by Λ=1ħG(, where G is the
                  gravitational constant, me the electron mass, and α
                  the low-energy limit of the fine structure
                  constant. This formula is in perfect agreement with
                  current WMAP data. Our approach gives physical
                  meaning to the Eddington-Dirac large-number
                  hypothesis and suggests that the observed value of
                  the cosmological constant is not at all unnatural.},

  abstract =     {The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm of
                  Milgrom can boast of a number of successful
                  predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these are
                  made without the assumption that dark matter plays a
                  significant role. MOND requires gravitation to
                  depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic
                  regime where dynamical accelerations are small.  So
                  far relativistic gravitation theories proposed to
                  underpin MOND have either clashed with the
                  post-Newtonian tests of general relativity, or
                  failed to provide significant gravitational lensing,
                  or violated hallowed principles by exhibiting
                  superluminal scalar waves or an a priori vector
                  field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired
                  theory which resolves these problems. In it
                  gravitation is mediated by metric, a scalar, and a
                  4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple
                  choice of its free function, the theory has a
                  Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic dynamics with
                  significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when
                  accelerations are small. We calculate the β and γ
                  parameterized post-Newtonian coefficients showing
                  them to agree with solar system measurements. The
                  gravitational light deflection by nonrelativistic
                  systems is governed by the same potential
                  responsible for dynamics of particles. To the extent
                  that MOND successfully describes dynamics of a
                  system, the new theory’s predictions for lensing by
                  that system’s visible matter will agree as well with
                  observations as general relativity’s predictions
                  made with a dynamically successful dark halo
                  model. Cosmological models based on the theory are
                  quite similar to those based on general relativity;
                  they predict slow evolution of the scalar field. For
                  a range of initial conditions, this last result
                  makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation
                  of metric, scalar, and vector waves.},

                  of 10 new Milky Way satellites with effective
                  surface brightness μv>~28 mag arcsec-2 have been
                  discovered in SDSS data. They are less luminous,
                  more irregular, and apparently more metal-poor than
                  the previously known nine Milky Way dwarf
                  spheroidals. The relationship between these objects
                  and other populations is discussed. We note that
                  there is a paucity of objects with half-light radii
                  between ~40 and ~100 pc. We conjecture that this may
                  represent the division between star clusters and
                  dwarf galaxies.  Based in part on data collected at
                  Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National
                  Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

                  Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration
                  (SEGUE). We followed this up with deeper imaging and
                  spectroscopy on the Multiple Mirror Telescope
                  (MMT). From this, we derive a luminosity of Mv =
                  -2.5, a half-light radius of 34 pc and a systemic
                  velocity of ~ -40kms-1. Our data also provide
                  evidence for a stream around Segue 2 at a similar
                  heliocentric velocity, and the SEGUE data show that
                  it is also present in neighbouring fields.  We
                  resolve the velocity dispersion of Segue 2 as 3.4
                  kms-1 and the possible stream as ~7kms-1. This
                  object shows points of comparison with other recent
                  discoveries, Segue 1, Boo II and Coma. We speculate
                  that all four objects may be representatives of a
                  population of satellites of satellites - survivors
                  of accretion events that destroyed their larger but
                  less dense parents. They are likely to have formed
                  at redshifts z > 10 and are good candidates for
                  fossils of the reionization epoch.},

  abstract =     {We present a novel pair of numerical models of the
                  interaction history between the Large and Small
                  Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) and
                  our Milky Way (MW) in light of recent high-precision
                  proper motions from the Hubble Space
                  Telescope. Given the updated velocities,
                  cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure
                  formation favour a scenario where the Magellanic
                  Clouds (MCs) are currently on their first infall
                  towards ourGalaxy. We illustrate here that the
                  observed irregular morphology and internal
                  kinematics of the Magellanic System (in gas and
                  stars) are naturally explained by interactions
                  between the LMC and SMC, rather than gravitational
                  interactions with the MW. These conclusions provide
                  further support that the MCs are completing their
                  first infall to our system. In particular, we
                  demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a band of H
                  I gas trailing behind the Clouds 150° across the
                  sky, can be accounted for by the action of LMC tides
                  on the SMC before the system was accreted by the
                  MW. We further demonstrate that the off-centre,
                  warped stellar bar of the LMC, and its one-armed
                  spiral can be naturally explained by a recent direct
                  collision with its lower mass companion, the
                  SMC. Such structures are key morphological
                  characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to
                  as Magellanic Irregulars, the majority of which are
                  not associated with massive spiral galaxies. We
                  infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions are
                  important drivers for the morphological evolution of
                  Magellanic Irregulars and can dramatically affect
                  the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxies
                  via the formation of extended tidal bridges and
                  tails.  Such interactions are not only important for
                  the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have direct
                  consequences for the build-up of baryons in our own
                  MW, as LMC-mass systems are believed to be the
                  dominant building blocks of MW-type haloes.},

                  million dark matter haloes identified at z = 0 in
                  the Millennium simulation. Our sample spans halo
                  masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy
                  clusters. The very large dynamic range of this cold
                  dark matter cosmological simulation enables the
                  distribution of spins and shapes and their variation
                  with halo mass and environment to be characterized
                  with unprecedented precision.  We compare results
                  for haloes identified using three different
                  algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in
                  the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by
                  the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We
                  introduce a novel halo definition called the TREE
                  halo, based on the branches of the halo merger
                  trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with
                  real astronomical objects than the traditional
                  ‘friends-of-friends’ and ‘spherical overdensity’
                  (SO) algorithms.  We find that for this many
                  objects, the traditional lognormal function is no
                  longer an adequate description of the distribution,
                  P(λ), of the dimensionless spin parameter λ, and we
                  provide a different function that gives a better fit
                  for TREE and SO haloes.  The variation in spin with
                  halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend
                  depends strongly on the halo definition used. For
                  the entire population of haloes, we find median
                  values of λmed = 0.0367–0.0429, depending on the
                  definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of
                  shapes, with a preference for prolateness over
                  oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less
                  spherical and more prolate.  We find that the
                  more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in
                  the median, and those closest to being spherical
                  have a spin independent of mass (λmed ≈ 0.033). The
                  most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape
                  (λmed ≈ 0.032). The majority of haloes have their
                  angular momentum vector aligned with their minor
                  axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find
                  a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more
                  clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive
                  haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be
                  larger than a factor of ∼2.},

  abstract =     {We have performed a detailed statistical study of
                  the evolution of structure in a photoionized
                  intergalactic medium (IGM) using analytical
                  simulations to extend the calculation into the
                  mildly nonlinear density regime found to prevail at
                  z = 3. Our work is based on a simple fundamental
                  conjecture: that the probability distribution
                  function of the density of baryonic diffuse matter
                  in the universe is described by a lognormal (LN)
                  random field. The LN distribution has several
                  attractive features and follows plausibly from the
                  assumption of initial linear Gaussian density and
                  velocity fluctuations at arbitrarily early
                  times. Starting with a suitably normalized power
                  spectrum of primordial fluctuations in a universe
                  dominated by cold dark matter (CDM), we compute the
                  behavior of the baryonic matter, which moves slowly
                  toward minima in the dark matter potential on scales
                  larger than the Jeans length.  We have computed two
                  models that succeed in matching observations.  One
                  is a nonstandard CDM model with Omega = 1, h = 0.5,
                  and Gamma = 0.3, and the other is a low-density flat
                  model with a cosmological constant (LCDM), with
                  Omega = 0.4, Omega Lamda = 0.6, and h = 0.65.  In
                  both models, the variance of the density
                  distribution function grows with time, reaching
                  unity at about z = 4, where the simulation yields
                  spectra that closely resemble the Ly alpha forest
                  absorption seen in the spectra of high-z
                  quasars. The calculations also successfully predict
                  the observed properties of the Ly alpha forest
                  clouds and their evolution from z = 4 down to at
                  least z = 2, assuming a constant intensity for the
                  metagalactic UV background over this redshift range.
                  However, in our model the forest is not due to
                  discrete clouds, but rather to fluctuations in a
                  continuous intergalactic medium. At z = 3, typical
                  clouds with measured neutral hydrogen column
                  densities NH I = 1015.3, 1013.5, and 1011.5 cm-2
                  correspond to fluctuations with mean total densities
                  approximately 10, 1, and 0.1 times the universal
                  mean baryon density. Perhaps surprisingly,
                  fluctuations whose amplitudes are less than or equal
                  to the mean density still appear as "clouds" because
                  in our model more than 70 percent of the volume of the IGM
                  at z = 3 is filled with gas at densities below the
                  mean value. We find that the column density
                  distribution of Ly alpha forest lines can be fitted
                  to f(N_{{H} {I}})~N^{- beta }_{{H} {I}} , with beta
                  = 1.46 in the range 12.5 < log NH I < 14.5, matching
                  recent Keck results. At somewhat higher column
                  densities the distribution steepens, giving beta =
                  1.80 over the range 14.0 < log NH I < 15.5, matching
                  earlier observations for these stronger lines. The
                  normalization of the line numbers in our model also
                  agrees with observations if the total baryon density
                  is Omega b = 0.015 h-2 and the ionizing background
                  intensity is J21 = 0.18. Alternatively, if J21 = 0.5
                  as recently estimated for the background due to
                  observed quasars at z = 2.5, then Omega b = 0.025
                  h-2 yields the observed number of Ly alpha lines and
                  the observed mean opacity. The model predicts that
                  about 80 percent of the baryons in the universe are
                  associated with Ly alpha forest features with 13 <
                  log NH I < 15 at z = 3, while 10 percent are in more
                  diffuse gas with smaller column densities and 10 percent
                  are in higher column density clouds and in collapsed
                  structures, such as galaxies and quasars. Our model
                  requires that absorbers at z = 3 with column
                  densities higher than about 1016 cm-2---Lyman limit
                  systems and damped Ly alpha systems---represent a
                  separate population that has collapsed out of the
                  IGM. We find the number density of forest lines is
                  dN/dz = 75[(1 + z)/4]2.5 for lines with EW > 0.32
                  Angstroms, also in good agreement with
                  observations. We fit Voigt profiles to our simulated
                  lines and find a distribution of b parameters that
                  matches that obtained from similar fits to real
                  spectra. The effective opacity in the Ly alpha
                  forest is found from the model to be tau eff =
                  0.26[(1 + z)/4]3.1, again in good agreement with
                  observations. The exponents for the evolution of the
                  number of lines and the effective opacity do not
                  simply differ by 1.0, as in the standard cloud
                  picture, owing to saturation effects for the
                  stronger lines. This also explains why the effective
                  opacity evolves more slowly than (1 + z)4.5, which
                  is expected for the Gunn-Peterson effect in a
                  uniform medium with J = constant (and Omega = 1). We
                  compare the spectral filling factor for our CDM and
                  LCDM models with observations of the Ly alpha forest
                  in HS 1700+64 and find good agreement. Similar
                  calculations for a standard CDM model and a cold
                  plus hot dark matter model fail to match the
                  observed spectral filling factor function. We have
                  also compared a number of predictions of our
                  analytical model with results of numerical
                  hydrodynamical calculations (Miralda-Escude et
                  al. 1996) and again find them to be in good
                  agreement. The lognormal hypothesis, coupled with
                  otherwise attractive CDM-dominated cosmological
                  models, appears to provide a plausible and useful
                  description of the distribution of photoionized
                  intergalactic gas and provides a new estimate of the
                  baryonic density of the universe.},

  abstract =     {Many galaxy clusters pose a 'cooling-flow problem',
                  where the observed X-ray emission from their cores
                  is not accompanied by enough cold gas or star
                  formation. A continuous energy source is required to
                  balance the cooling rate over the whole core
                  volume. We address the feasibility of a
                  gravitational heating mechanism, utilizing the
                  gravitational energy released by the gas that
                  streams into the potential well of the cluster dark
                  matter halo. We focus here on a specific form of
                  gravitational heating in which the energy is
                  transferred to the medium thorough the drag exerted
                  on inflowing gas clumps. Using spherisymmetric hydro
                  simulations with a subgrid representation of these
                  clumps, we confirm our earlier estimates that in
                  haloes ≥1013 Msun the gravitational heating is more
                  efficient than the cooling everywhere. The worry was
                  that this could overheat the core and generate an
                  instability that might push it away from
                  equilibrium. However, we find that the overheating
                  does not change the global halo properties, and that
                  convection can stabilize the cluster by carrying
                  energy away from the overheated core. In a typical
                  rich cluster of 1014-15 Msun, with ˜5 per cent of
                  the accreted baryons in gas clumps of ˜108 Msun, we
                  derive upper and lower limits for the temperature
                  and entropy profiles and show that they are
                  consistent with those observed in cool-core
                  clusters. We predict the density and mass of cold
                  gas and the level of turbulence driven by the clump
                  accretion. We conclude that gravitational heating is
                  a feasible mechanism for preventing cooling flows in
                  clusters.},

                  identify a population of 508 X-ray-selected active
                  galactic nuclei (AGN) at 0.4 < z < 6 residing within
                  host galaxies with stellar masses in the range 1010
                  Msun < M* < 1012 Msun.  From this sample we
                  construct a volume-limited complete sample of 85 AGN
                  with host galaxy stellar masses M* > 1010.5 Msun,
                  and specific X-ray luminosities LX > 2.35 × 1043 erg
                  s-1 at 0.4 < z < 3. We calculate the Eddington
                  limiting masses of the supermassive black holes
                  (SMBHs) residing at the centre of these galaxies,
                  and observe an increase in the average Eddington
                  limiting black hole mass with redshift.  While the
                  black hole mass and Eddington ratio, μ, are
                  degenerate, if we assume that the local MBH - M*
                  relation holds at all redshifts we find that the
                  mean Eddington ratio μ rises from 0.056 ± 0.010 at
                  z= 0.7 to 0.087 ± 0.011 at z= 1.25, with no
                  significant evolution thereafter to z=
                  3. Alternatively, by assuming that there is no
                  evolution in μ and then that there is maximum
                  possible evolution to the Eddington limit, we
                  quantify the maximum possible evolution in the
                  M*/MBH ratio as lying in the range 700 < M*/MBH < 10
                  000, compared with the local value of M*/MBH˜
                  1000. We furthermore find that the fraction of
                  galaxies which are AGN (with LX > 2.35 × 1043 erg
                  s-1) rises with redshift from 1.2 ± 0.2 per cent at
                  z= 0.7 to 7.4 ± 2.0 per cent at z= 2.5.  We use our
                  results to calculate the maximum time-scales for
                  which our sample of AGN can continue to accrete at
                  their observed rates before surpassing the local
                  galaxy-black hole mass relation. We use these
                  time-scales to calculate the total fraction of
                  massive galaxies which will be active (with LX >
                  2.35 × 1043 erg s-1) since z= 3, finding that at
                  least ˜40 per cent of all massive galaxies will be
                  Seyfert luminosity AGN or brighter during this
                  epoch. Further, we calculate the energy density due
                  to AGN activity in the Universe as 1.0 (±0.3) × 1057
                  erg Mpc-3 Gyr-1, potentially providing a significant
                  source of energy for AGN feedback on star
                  formation. We also use this method to compute the
                  evolution in the X-ray luminosity density of AGN
                  with redshift, finding that massive galaxy Seyfert
                  luminosity AGN are the dominant source of X-ray
                  emission in the Universe at z < 3.},

                  roughly 10 percent baryonic matter by mass and that
                  baryons sink dissipatively by about a factor of 10
                  in. radius during galaxy formation. It is shown that
                  such infall strongly perturbs the underlying dark
                  matter distribution, pulling it inward and creating
                  cores that are considerably smaller and denser than
                  would have evolved without dissipation. Any
                  discontinuity between the baryonic and dark matter
                  mass distributions is smoothed out by the coupled
                  motions of the two components. If dark halos have
                  large core radii in the absence of dissipation, the
                  above infall scenario yields rotation curves that
                  are flat over large distances, in agreement with
                  observations of spiral galaxies. Such large
                  dissipationless cores may plausibly result from
                  large internal kinetic energy in protogalaxies at
                  maximum expansion, perhaps as a result of

  abstract =     {We develop a picture of cosmic structure formation
                  that identifies virialized cosmological objects with
                  a point process of "peak patches" in the initial
                  (Lagrangian) space. The strongly nonlinear internal
                  dynamics of the collapsing patch is largely
                  decoupled from the weakly nonlinear dynamics
                  describing peak-patch flow. A modest set of local
                  field measurements on the patch region suffices to
                  approximately determine the fate of the peak. The
                  candidate peak points are identified using a
                  hierarchy of smoothing operations on the density
                  field. Patch size and mass are found by requiring
                  complete collapse of a homogeneous ellipsoid model
                  for internal patch dynamics which includes the
                  important influence of the external tidal
                  field. Exclusion algorithms that prevent peak-patch
                  overlaps trim the candidate list into the final
                  "hierarchical peak" list. The Zeldovich
                  approximation with locally adaptive filtering of the
                  displacement field is used for external dynamics to
                  move the surviving patches to their final state
                  (Eulerian) positions, augmented by a quadratic
                  nonlinear correction where necessary.  Thus both
                  statistical and dynamical clustering of the peaks
                  are included.  Our technique is the natural
                  generalization of both the Press-Schechter method
                  (to include nonlocal effects) and the BBKS
                  single-filter peaks theory (to allow a mass spectrum
                  and solve the cloud-in-cloud problem).  It allows
                  efficient Monte Carlo constructions of
                  three-dimensional catalogs of objects such as groups
                  and clusters of galaxies, and, with more selection
                  criteria, of galaxies in their formation phases.},

  abstract =     {We present results on the X-ray properties of
                  clusters and groups of galaxies, extracted from a
                  large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation.  We
                  used the TREE+SPH code GADGET to simulate a
                  concordance Λ cold dark matter cosmological model
                  within a box of 192 h-1 Mpc on a side, 4803 dark
                  matter particles and as many gas particles. The
                  simulation includes radiative cooling assuming zero
                  metallicity, star formation and supernova
                  feedback. The very high dynamic range of the
                  simulation allows us to cover a fairly large
                  interval of cluster temperatures.  We compute X-ray
                  observables of the intracluster medium (ICM) for
                  simulated groups and clusters and analyse their
                  statistical properties.  The simulated
                  mass-temperature relation is consistent with
                  observations once we mimic the procedure for mass
                  estimates applied to real clusters.  Also, with the
                  adopted choices of Ωm= 0.3 and σ8= 0.8 for matter
                  density and power spectrum normalization,
                  respectively, the resulting X-ray temperature
                  function agrees with the most recent observational
                  determinations. The luminosity-temperature relation
                  also agrees with observations for clusters with T> 2
                  keV. At the scale of groups, T<~ 1 keV, we find no
                  change of slope in this relation. The entropy in
                  central cluster regions is higher than predicted by
                  gravitational heating alone, the excess being almost
                  the same for clusters and groups. We also find that
                  the simulated clusters appear to have suffered some
                  overcooling. We find f*~= 0.2 for the fraction of
                  baryons in stars within clusters, thus approximately
                  twice as large as the value observed. Interestingly,
                  temperature profiles of simulated clusters are found
                  to increase steadily toward cluster centres. They
                  decrease in the outer regions, much like
                  observational data do at r>~ 0.2rvir, while not
                  showing an isothermal regime followed by a smooth
                  temperature decline in the innermost regions. Our
                  results thus demonstrate the need for yet more
                  efficient sources of energy feedback and/or the need
                  to consider additional physical process which may be
                  able to further suppress the gas density at the
                  scale of poor clusters and groups, and, at the same
                  time, to regulate the cooling of the ICM in central
                  regions.},

                  substructure and turbulence in hydrodynamic
                  [adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)] galaxy simulations
                  with resolutions up to 0.8 pc and 5 × 103 Msun. We
                  analyse the power spectrum of the density
                  distribution, and various components of the velocity
                  field. We show that the disc thickness is about the
                  average Jeans scalelength, and is mainly regulated
                  by gravitational instabilities. From this scale of
                  energy injection, a turbulence cascade towards small
                  scale is observed, with almost isotropic small-scale
                  motions. On scales larger than the disc thickness,
                  density waves are observed, but there is also a full
                  range of substructures with chaotic and strongly
                  non-isotropic gas velocity dispersions. The power
                  spectrum of vorticity in a Large Magellanic Cloud
                  sized model suggests that an inverse cascade of
                  turbulence might be present, although energy input
                  over a wide range of scales in the coupled
                  gaseous+stellar fluid could also explain this
                  quasi-two-dimensional regime on scales larger than
                  the disc scaleheight. Similar regimes of gas
                  turbulence are also found in massive high-redshift
                  discs with high gas fractions. Disc properties and
                  ISM turbulence appear to be mainly regulated by
                  gravitational processes, both on large scales and
                  inside dense clouds. Star formation feedback is
                  however essential to maintain the ISM in a steady
                  state by balancing a systematic gas dissipation into
                  dense and small clumps. Our galaxy simulations
                  employ a thermal model based on a barotropic
                  equation of state aimed at modelling the equilibrium
                  of gas between various heating and cooling
                  processes. Denser gas is typically colder in this
                  approach, which is shown to correctly reproduce the
                  density structures of a star-forming, turbulent,
                  unstable and cloudy ISM down to scales of a few
                  parsecs.},

  abstract =     {Disk galaxies at high redshift (z ~ 2) are
                  characterized by high fractions of cold gas, strong
                  turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. Major
                  mergers of disk galaxies at high redshift should
                  then generally involve such turbulent clumpy
                  disks. Merger simulations, however, model the
                  interstellar medium as a stable, homogeneous, and
                  thermally pressurized medium. We present the first
                  merger simulations with high fractions of cold,
                  turbulent, and clumpy gas. We discuss the major new
                  features of these models compared to models where
                  the gas is artificially stabilized and warmed. Gas
                  turbulence, which is already strong in high-redshift
                  disks, is further enhanced in mergers. Some phases
                  are dispersion dominated, with most of the gas
                  kinetic energy in the form of velocity dispersion
                  and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger
                  models using a thermally stabilized gas. These
                  mergers can reach very high star formation rates,
                  and have multi-component gas spectra consistent with
                  SubMillimeter Galaxies. Major mergers with high
                  fractions of cold turbulent gas are also
                  characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to
                  the center of mass, with the stellar component
                  following in a global contraction. The final
                  galaxies are early type with relatively small radii
                  and high Sersic indices, like high-redshift compact
                  spheroids. The mass fraction in a disk component
                  that survives or re-forms after a merger is severely
                  reduced compared to models with stabilized gas, and
                  the formation of a massive disk component would
                  require significant accretion of external baryons
                  afterwards. Mergers thus appear to destroy extended
                  disks even when the gas fraction is high, and this
                  lends further support to smooth infall as the main
                  formation mechanism for massive disk galaxies.},

                  cosmological scales, in particular how galaxies get
                  their baryons. There is increasing recognition that
                  a large part of the baryons accrete smoothly onto
                  galaxies, and that internal evolution processes play
                  a major role in shaping galaxies - mergers are not
                  necessarily the dominant process. However,
                  predictions from the various assembly mechanisms are
                  still in large disagreement with the observed
                  properties of galaxies in the nearby Universe.
                  Small-scale processes have a major impact on the
                  global evolution of galaxies over a Hubble time and
                  the usual sub-grid models account for them in a far
                  too uncertain way. Understanding when, where and at
                  which rate galaxies formed their stars becomes
                  crucial to understand the formation of galaxy
                  populations. I discuss recent improvements and
                  current limitations in ``resolved'' modeling of star
                  formation, aiming at explicitly capturing
                  star-forming instabilities, in cosmological and
                  galaxy-sized simulations. Such models need to
                  develop three-dimensional turbulence in the ISM,
                  which requires parsec-scale resolution at redshift

                  host any of its bright satellites (LV > 105 Lsun).
                  These dark subhaloes have peak circular velocities
                  at infall of Vinfall= 30-70 km s-1 and infall masses
                  of (0.2-4) × 1010 Msun. Unless the Milky Way is a
                  statistical anomaly, this implies that galaxy
                  formation becomes effectively stochastic at these
                  masses. This is in marked contrast to the
                  well-established monotonic relation between galaxy
                  luminosity and halo circular velocity (or halo mass)
                  for more massive haloes. We show that at least two

                  circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in
                  dwarf satellites or different dark matter physics
                  can reduce the central densities of massive

                  most massive subhaloes in galaxy-mass dark matter
                  (DM) haloes in Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) are grossly
                  inconsistent with the dynamics of the brightest
                  Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. While the
                  best-fitting hosts of the dwarf spheroidals all have
                  ?, ΛCDM simulations predict at least 10 subhaloes
                  with Vmax > 25 km s-1. These subhaloes are also
                  among the most massive at earlier times, and
                  significantly exceed the reionization suppression
                  mass back to z˜ 10. No ΛCDM-based model of the
                  satellite population of the Milky Way explains this
                  result. The problem lies in the satellites'
                  densities: it is straightforward to match the
                  observed Milky Way luminosity function, but doing so
                  requires the dwarf spheroidals to have DM haloes
                  that are a factor of ˜5 more massive than is
                  observed. Independent of the difficulty in
                  explaining the absence of these dense, massive
                  subhaloes, there is a basic tension between the
                  derived properties of the bright Milky Way dwarf
                  spheroidals and ΛCDM expectations. The inferred
                  infall masses of these galaxies are all
                  approximately equal and are much lower than standard
                  ΛCDM predictions for systems with their
                  luminosities. Consequently, their implied star
                  formation efficiencies span over two orders of
                  magnitude, from 0.2 to 20 per cent of baryons
                  converted into stars, in stark contrast with
                  expectations gleaned from more massive galaxies. We
                  explore possible solutions to these problems within
                  the context of ΛCDM and find them to be
                  unconvincing. In particular, we use controlled
                  simulations to demonstrate that the small stellar
                  masses of the bright dwarf spheroidals make
                  supernova feedback an unlikely explanation for their
                  low inferred densities.},

                  Survey. We find for a magnitude cut of bJ<20.5,
                  corresponding to a median galaxy redshift of z~0.1,
                  and 2×106 galaxies, that the galaxy ellipticities
                  exhibit a non-zero correlation over a range of
                  scales between 1 and 100arcmin. We detect this
                  correlation in two colours, bJ and R and, most
                  significantly, in the cross-correlation between the
                  two bands, which is less likely to be contaminated
                  by systematics. In particular, we measure the
                  variance of mean galaxy ellipticities, σ2(θ), in
                  square angular cells on the sky as a function of

                  15<=θ<=100arcmin. Considering the low median
                  redshift of the galaxies in the sample and hence the

                  of these galaxies by the large-scale structure of

                  numerical predictions made for intrinsic galaxy
                  alignment and find good agreement. We discuss the
                  importance of these results for measuring cosmic
                  shear from upcoming shallow surveys (e.g. the Sloan
                  Digital Sky Survey) and we outline how these
                  measurements could possibly be used to constrain
                  models of galaxy formation and/or measure the mass

                  matter haloes surrounding the largest cosmological
                  voids are oriented. We find that the major and
                  intermediate axes of the haloes tend to lie parallel
                  to the surface of the voids, whereas the minor axis
                  points preferentially in the radial direction.  We
                  have quantified the strength of these alignments at
                  different radial distances from the void
                  centres. The effect of these orientations is still
                  detected at distances as large as 2.2 Rvoid from the
                  void centre. Taking a subsample of haloes expected
                  to contain disc-dominated galaxies at their centres
                  we detect, at the 99.9 per cent confidence level, a
                  signal that the angular momentum of those haloes
                  tends to lie parallel to the surface of the
                  voids. Contrary to the alignments of the inertia
                  axes, this signal is only detected in shells at the
                  void surface (1 < R < 1.07Rvoid) and disappears at
                  larger distances.  This signal, together with the
                  similar alignment observed using real spiral
                  galaxies, strongly supports the prediction of the
                  Tidal Torque theory that both dark matter haloes and
                  baryonic matter have acquired, conjointly, their
                  angular momentum before the moment of turnaround.},

                  and open cold dark matter). We find that the
                  analytic formulae provide a good description of the
                  relations between three of the four numerical
                  quantities.  The fourth (luminosity) also agrees
                  once we introduce a procedure to correct for the
                  fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the
                  normalizations for the virial relations and compare
                  extensively to the existing literature, finding
                  remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter
                  prescription is calibrated with the simulations,
                  again finding results consistent with other
                  authors. We also examine related issues such as the
                  size of the scatter in the virial relations, the
                  effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the
                  structure of the halos.  All of this is done in
                  order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of
                  clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for
                  the models are briefly discussed.},

  abstract =     {We study the angular momentum profiles of a
                  statistical sample of halos drawn from a
                  high-resolution N-body simulation of the ΛCDM
                  cosmology. We find that the cumulative mass
                  distribution of specific angular momentum j in a
                  halo of mass Mv is well fitted by a universal
                  function, M(<j)=Mvμj/(j0+j). This profile is defined
                  by one shape parameter (μ or j0) in addition to the
                  global spin parameter λ. It follows a power law
                  M(<j)~j over most of the mass and flattens at large
                  j, with the flattening more pronounced for small
                  values of μ (or large j0 at a fixed λ). Compared to
                  a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, most halos
                  have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and
                  high-j tails of the distribution. High-λ halos tend
                  to have high μ values, corresponding to a narrower,
                  more uniform j distribution.  The spatial
                  distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to
                  be cylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo
                  for ~80 percent of the halos. The more misaligned halos
                  tend to have low μ values. When averaged over
                  spherical shells encompassing mass M, the halo j
                  profiles are fitted by j(M)~Ms with s=1.3+/-0.3. We
                  investigate two ideas for the origin of this
                  profile. The first is based on a revised version of
                  linear tidal-torque theory combined with extended
                  Press-Schechter mass accretion, and the second
                  focuses on j transport in minor mergers.  Finally,
                  we briefly explore implications of the M(<j) profile
                  on the formation of galactic disks assuming that j
                  is conserved during an adiabatic baryonic
                  infall. The implied gas density profile deviates
                  from an exponential disk, with a higher density at
                  small radii and a tail extending to large radii. The
                  steep central density profiles may imply disk scale
                  lengths that are smaller than observed. This is
                  reminiscent of the ``angular momentum problem'' seen
                  in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have
                  assumed perfect j conservation.  A possible solution
                  is to associate the central excesses with bulge
                  components and the outer regions with extended
                  gaseous disks.},

  abstract =     {We derive the weight function w(M) to apply to
                  dark-matter haloes that minimizes the stochasticity
                  between the weighted halo distribution and its
                  underlying mass density field. The optimal w(M)
                  depends on the range of masses being used in the
                  estimator. While the standard biased-Poisson model
                  of the halo distribution predicts that bias
                  weighting is optimal, the simple fact that the mass
                  is comprised of haloes implies that the optimal w(M)
                  will be a mixture of mass-weighting and
                  bias-weighting. In N-body simulations, the Poisson
                  estimator is up to 15× noisier than the
                  optimal. Implementation of the optimal weight yields
                  significantly lower stochasticity than weighting
                  haloes by their mass, bias or equal weighting in
                  most circumstances. Optimal weighting could make
                  cosmological tests based on the matter power
                  spectrum or cross-correlations much more powerful
                  and/or cost effective.  A volume-limited measurement
                  of the mass power spectrum at k= 0.2 h Mpc-1 over
                  the entire z < 1 universe could ideally be done
                  using only 6 million redshifts of haloes with mass M
                  > 6 × 1013 h-1 Msun (1 × 1013) at z= 0 (z= 1); this
                  is 5× fewer than what the Poisson model
                  predicts. Using halo occupancy distributions (HODs)
                  we find that uniformly weighted catalogues of
                  luminous red galaxies require ≥3× more redshifts
                  than an optimally weighted halo catalogue to
                  reconstruct the mass to the same accuracy. While the
                  mean HODs of galaxies chosen to lie above a
                  threshold luminosity are fortuitously very similar
                  to the optimal w(M), the stochasticity of the halo
                  occupation degrades the mass estimator. Blue or
                  emission-line galaxies are ≈100× less efficient at
                  reconstructing mass than an optimal weighting
                  scheme.  This suggests an efficient observational
                  approach of identifying and weighting haloes with a
                  deep photo-z survey before conducting a
                  spectroscopic survey. The optimal w(M) and
                  mass-estimator stochasticity predicted by the
                  standard halo model for M > 1012 h-1 Msun are in
                  reasonable agreement with our measurements, with the
                  important exceptions that the haloes must be assumed
                  to be linearly biased samples of a ‘halo field’ that
                  is distinct from the mass field. Halo catalogues
                  extending below 1012 h-1 Msun are more stochastic
                  than the halo model predicts, suggesting that halo
                  exclusion or other effects violate the assumption
                  that haloes sample this halo field via a Poisson
                  process.},

                  uncorrelated intrinsic ellipticities of target
                  sources that is usually made in searches for weak
                  gravitational lensing arising from large-scale mass
                  inhomogeneities (`field lensing') is unwarranted. If
                  the orientation of the galaxy image is determined
                  either by the angular momentum or by the shape of
                  the halo in which it forms, then the image should be
                  aligned preferentially with the component of the
                  tidal gravitational field perpendicular to the line
                  of sight. Long-range correlations in the tidal field
                  will thus lead to long-range ellipticity-ellipticity
                  correlations that mimic the shear correlations
                  arising from weak gravitational lensing. We
                  calculate the ellipticity-ellipticity correlation
                  expected if halo shapes determine the observed
                  galaxy shape, and we discuss uncertainties (which
                  are still considerable) in the predicted amplitude
                  of this correlation. The ellipticity-ellipticity
                  correlation induced by angular momenta should be
                  smaller. We consider several methods for
                  discriminating between the weak-lensing (extrinsic)
                  and intrinsic correlations, including the use of
                  redshift information. An ellipticity-tidal-field
                  correlation also implies the existence of an
                  alignment of images of galaxies near
                  clusters. Although the intrinsic alignment may
                  complicate the interpretation of field-lensing
                  results, it is inherently interesting as it may shed
                  light on galaxy formation as well as on structure

                  described as a rank-4 tensor, the elements of which

                  functions ranging, with respect to the spatial
                  separation, from purely transversal to purely
                  longitudinal correlations. Tidal fields, on both
                  galaxy and cluster scales, are revealed to be
                  correlated over distances larger than the
                  mass-density correlation length, although traceless
                  tidal fields show anti-correlation between diagonal
                  terms along orthogonal directions. The
                  cross-correlation between mass and tidal field is
                  also analysed. These results are relevant for galaxy

  abstract =     {The growth of the angular momentum L of
                  protogalaxies induced by tidal torques is
                  reconsidered. We adopt White's formalism and study
                  the evolution of L in Lagrangian coordinates; the
                  motion of the fluid elements is described by the
                  Zel'dovich approximation. We obtain a general
                  expression for the ensemble expectation value of the
                  square of L in terms of the first and second
                  invariant of the inertia tensor of the Lagrangian
                  volume Lambda enclosing the collapsing mass of the
                  proto-object. We then specialize the formalism to
                  the particular case in which Lambda is centred on a
                  peak of the smoothed Gaussian density field and
                  approximated by an isodensity ellipsoid. The result
                  is the appropriate analytical estimate for the rms
                  angular momentum of peaks to be compared against
                  simulations that make use of the Hoffman-Ribak
                  algorithm to set up a constrained density field that
                  contains a peak with given shape. Extending the work
                  of Heavens & Peacock, we calculate the joint
                  probability distribution function for several spin
                  parameters and peak mass M using the distribution of
                  peak shapes, for different initial power
                  spectra. The probability distribution for the rms
                  final angular momentum <L^2_f>^1/2 on the scales
                  corresponding to common bright galaxies, M~=10^11M_,
                  is centred on a value of ~=10^67 kg m^2 s^-1, for
                  any cosmologically relevant power spectrum, in line
                  with previous theoretical and observational
                  estimates for L_f. Other astrophysical consequences
                  are discussed.  In particular, we find that typical
                  values <lambda^2>^1/2~=0.1 of the dimensionless spin
                  parameter for peaks smoothed on galactic scales and
                  of height nu~1, usually associated with late-type
                  galaxies, may be recovered in the framework of the
                  Gaussian peak formalism. This partially relaxes the
                  importance attributed to dissipative processes in
                  generating such high values of centrifugal support
                  for spiral galaxies. In addition, the values of the
                  specific angular momentum versus mass - as deduced
                  from observations of rotational velocities and
                  photometric radii of spiral galaxies - are well
                  fitted by our theoretical isoprobability
                  contours. In contrast, the observed lower values for
                  the specific angular momentum for ellipticals of the
                  same mass cannot be accounted for within our
                  linear-regime investigation, highlighting the
                  importance of strongly non-linear phenomena to
                  explain the spin of such objects.},

                  is assumed to be Gaussian, and the non-linear
                  dynamics of the collisionless mass fluid is followed
                  using Lagrangian perturbation theory. For a cold
                  dark matter spectrum, the inclusion of the
                  leading-order Lagrangian correction terms results in
                  a value of the rms ensemble average <L^2>^1/2 which
                  is only a factor of 1.3 higher than the
                  corresponding linear estimate, irrespective of the

                  matter and for gas within virialized halos using a
                  statistical sample of halos drawn from cosmological
                  hydrodynamics simulations. Three simulations have
                  been analyzed: one is the nonradiative simulation
                  and the other two have radiative cooling. We find
                  that the gas component, on average, has a larger
                  spin and contains a smaller fraction of mass with
                  negative angular momentum than its dark matter
                  counterpart in the nonradiative model. As to the
                  cooling models, the gas component shares
                  approximately the same spin parameter as its dark
                  matter counterpart, but the hot gas has a higher
                  spin and is more aligned in angular momentum than
                  dark matter, while the opposite holds for the cold
                  gas. After the mass of negative angular momentum is
                  excluded, the angular momentum profile of the hot
                  gas component approximately follows the universal
                  function originally proposed by Bullock et al. for
                  dark matter, though the shape parameter μ is much
                  larger for hot gas and is comfortably in the range
                  required by observations of disk galaxies. Since
                  disk formation is related to the distribution of hot
                  gas that will cool, our study may explain the fact
                  that the disk component of observed galaxies
                  contains a smaller fraction of low angular momentum
                  material than dark matter in halos.},

  abstract =     {Following Bi & Davidsen, we perform one-dimensional
                  semianalytic simulations along the lines of sight to
                  model the intergalactic medium (IGM).  Since this
                  procedure is computationally efficient in probing
                  the parameter space-and reasonably accurate-we use
                  it to recover the values of various parameters
                  related to the IGM (for a fixed background
                  cosmology) by comparing the model predictions with
                  different observations.  For the currently favored
                  low-density cold dark matter model (Ωm=0.4, ΩΛ=0.6,
                  and h=0.65), we obtain, using statistics obtained
                  from the transmitted flux, constraints on (1) the
                  combination f=(ΩBh2)2/J-12, where ΩB is the baryonic
                  density parameter and J-12 is the total
                  photoionization rate in units of 10-12 s-1, (2)
                  temperature T0 corresponding to the mean density,
                  and (3) the slope γ of the effective equation of
                  state of the IGM at a mean redshift z~=2.5. We find
                  that 0.8<T0/(104 K)<2.5 and 1.3<γ<2.3, while the
                  constraint obtained on f is 0.0202<f<0.0322.  A
                  reliable lower bound on J-12 can be used to put a
                  lower bound on ΩBh2, which can be compared with
                  similar constraints obtained from big bang
                  nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave
                  background radiation studies. We find that if
                  J-12>1.2, the lower bound on ΩBh2 is in violation of
                  the BBN value.},

                  independent of assumptions regarding the nature of

                  two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component
                  and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are
                  spatially segregated. By using both wide-field
                  ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the
                  cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps
                  showing that the gravitational potential does not
                  trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic
                  mass component, but rather approximately traces the
                  distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance
                  spatial offset of the center of the total mass from
                  the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be

  abstract =     {The large-scale structure (LSS) in the Universe
                  comprises a complicated filamentary network of
                  matter. We study this network using a
                  high-resolution simulation of structure formation in
                  a Λ Cold Dark Matter cosmology.  We investigate the
                  distribution of matter between neighbouring large
                  haloes whose masses are comparable to massive
                  clusters of galaxies.  We identify a total of 228
                  filaments between neighbouring clusters.  Roughly
                  half of the filaments are either warped or lie off
                  the cluster-cluster axis. We find that straight
                  filaments, on the average, are shorter than warped
                  ones. Close cluster pairs with separation of 5 h-1
                  Mpc or less are always connected by a filament. At
                  separations between 15 and 20 h-1 Mpc, about a third
                  of cluster pairs are connected by a filament. On
                  average, more-massive clusters are connected to more
                  filaments than less-massive ones. This finding
                  indicates that the most-massive clusters form at the
                  intersections of the filamentary backbone of
                  LSS. For straight filaments, we compute mass
                  profiles.  Radial profiles show a fairly
                  well-defined radius, rs, beyond which the profiles
                  follow an r-2 power law fairly closely. For the
                  majority of filaments, rs lies between 1.5 and 2.0
                  h-1 Mpc. The enclosed overdensity inside rs varies
                  from a few times up to 25 times the mean density,
                  independent of the length of the filament. Along the
                  filaments' axes, material is not distributed
                  uniformly. Towards the clusters, the density rises,
                  indicating the presence of the cluster infall
                  regions.  Filaments have been suggested to cause
                  possible alignments between neighbouring
                  clusters. Looking at the nearest neighbour for each
                  cluster, we find that, up to a separation of about
                  15 h-1 Mpc, there is a filament present that could
                  account for alignment. In addition, we also find
                  some sheet-like connections between clusters. In
                  roughly a fifth of all cluster-cluster connections
                  where we could not identify a filament or sheet,
                  projection effects lead to filamentary structures in
                  the projected mass distribution.},

                  luminosity distribution of galaxies in a dark matter
                  halo as a function of the halo mass - we present an
                  empirical model to describe the redshift evolution
                  of the rest B-band galaxy luminosity function
                  (LF). The model is compared to various estimates of
                  the LF, in rest UV and B bands, out to a redshift of
                  6, including estimates of LFs of galaxy types
                  separated to red and blue galaxies. Using the
                  observed LFs out to z~ 5, we present a general
                  constraint on the redshift evolution of the central
                  galaxy-halo mass relation. The increase in the
                  number density of luminous galaxies, at the bright
                  end of the LF, can be explained as due to a
                  brightening of the luminosity of galaxies present in
                  dark matter halo centres, relative to the luminosity
                  of central galaxies in similar mass haloes
                  today. The lack of strong evolution in the faint end
                  of the LF, however, argues against a model involving
                  pure-luminosity evolution at all halo mass
                  scales. The increase in luminosity at the bright end
                  compensates the rapid decline in the number density
                  of massive haloes as the redshift is increased. The
                  decline in group to cluster-mass dark matter haloes
                  out to a redshift of ~2 is not important as the
                  central galaxy luminosity flattens at halo masses
                  around 1013Msolar. At redshifts ~2-3, however, the
                  density of bright galaxies begins to decrease due to
                  the rapid decline in the number density of dark
                  matter haloes at mass scales around and below
                  1013Msolar.  Based on a comparison of our
                  predictions to the measured ultraviolet (UV) LF of
                  galaxies at redshifts ~3, we estimate the
                  probability distribution of halo masses to host
                  Lyman break galaxies (LBGs).  This probability for
                  galaxies brighter than AB-absolute magnitudes of
                  -21, with a number density of ~5 × 10-3h3Mpc-3,
                  peaks at a halo mass of ~7 × 1011h-1Msolar with a 68
                  per cent confidence level of (4-21) ×
                  1011h-1Msolar. These estimates are consistent with

                  clustering statistics and recent estimates of halo
                  masses based on spectroscopic observations. For
                  galaxies brighter than AB-absolute magnitudes of -21
                  at z~ 6, the halo mass scale is a factor of ~2
                  smaller; the LF predictions at z~ 6 are consistent
                  with measured estimates in the literature. Based on
                  the models, we also predict the LF of galaxies at
                  redshifts greater than 6 and also the bias factor of
                  galaxies at redshifts greater than 3; these
                  predictions will soon be tested with observational
                  data. In general, to explain high-redshift LFs,
                  galaxies in dark matter haloes around 1012Msolar
                  must increase in luminosity by a factor of ~4-6

                  tidal torques exerted on neighboring protogalaxies
                  by the smoothly varying shear field. We compute the
                  predicted amplitude of such ellipticity correlations
                  using the Zeldovich approximation for a realistic
                  distribution of galaxy shapes. Weak gravitational
                  lensing can also induce ellipticity correlations,
                  since the images of neighboring galaxies will be
                  distorted coherently. On comparing these two effects
                  that induce shape correlations, we find that for
                  current weak-lensing surveys with a median redshift
                  of zm=1, the intrinsic signal is of the order of
                  1-10 percent of the measured signal.  However, for
                  shallower surveys with zm<=0.3, the intrinsic
                  correlations dominate over the lensing signal. The

                  whereas those resulting from intrinsic alignments
                  are not. This difference can be used to disentangle

                  function (xi_cg), from the APM galaxy and galaxy
                  cluster surveys. We obtain estimates both in real
                  space from the inversion of projected statistics and
                  in redshift space using the galaxy and cluster
                  redshift samples.  The amplitude of xi_cg is found
                  to be almost independent of cluster richness. At
                  large separations, r >= 5 h^-1Mpc (h=H_0/100 km s^-1
                  Mpc^-1, where H_0 is the Hubble constant), xi_cg has
                  a similar shape to the galaxy-galaxy and
                  cluster-cluster autocorrelation functions.  xi_cg in
                  redshift space can be related to the real-space
                  xi_cg by convolution with an appropriate velocity
                  field model. Here we apply a spherical collapse
                  model, which we have tested against N-body
                  simulations, finding that it provides an accurate
                  description of the averaged infall velocity of
                  matter into galaxy clusters. We use this model to
                  estimate beta (beta =Ο^0.6/b, where b is the linear
                  bias parameter), and find that it tends to
                  overestimate the true result in simulations by only
                  10-30 per cent. Application to the APM results
                  yields beta =0.46 with beta < 0.73 at 95 per cent
                  confidence. This measure is complementary to the
                  estimates made of the density parameter from larger
                  scale bulk flows and from the virialized regions of
                  clusters on smaller scales. We also compare the APM
                  xi_cg and galaxy autocorrelations directly with the
                  mass correlation and cluster-mass correlations in
                  COBE-normalized simulations of popular cosmological
                  models, and derive two independent estimates of the
                  galaxy biasing expected as a function of scale. This
                  analysis reveals that both low-density and
                  critical-density COBE-normalized cold dark matter
                  (CDM) models require anti-biasing by a factor ~ 2 on
                  scales r <= 2 h^-1 Mpc, and that the mixed dark
                  matter (MDM) model is consistent with a constant
                  biasing factor on all scales. The critical-density
                  CDM model also suffers from the usual deficit of
                  power on large scales (r >= 20 h^-1 Mpc). We use the
                  velocity fields predicted from the different models
                  to distort the APM real-space cross-correlation
                  function.  Comparison with the APM redshift-space
                  xi^cg yields an estimate of the value of Ο^0.6
                  needed in each model. We find that only the low-Ο
                  model is fully consistent with observations, with
                  MDM marginally excluded at the ~ 2 sigma level.},

                  hydrodynamic simulation of the Λ cold dark matter
                  cosmology. At the redshift we concentrate on, z = 1,
                  the spatial resolution is 1.4 proper h-1kpc and the
                  mass resolution is such that Milky Way sized disc
                  galaxies contain ~105 particles within their virial
                  radii. The simulations include supermassive black
                  hole accretion and feedback as well as a multiphase
                  model for star formation. Overall, we find that a
                  number of familiar qualitative relationships hold
                  approximately between galaxy properties, for example
                  we observe galaxies as lying between two broad
                  extremes of type, where `late' types tend to be
                  smaller in size, have lower circular velocities,
                  younger stars, higher star formation rates, larger
                  disc to bulge ratios and lower Sersic indices than
                  `early types'. We find that as in previous studies
                  of small numbers of resimulated galaxies the stellar
                  component of disc galaxies is not as rotationally
                  supported as in observations. Bulges contain too
                  much of the stellar mass, although exponential discs
                  do have scalelengths compatible with observations,
                  and the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at z = 1
                  is reproduced. The addition of black hole physics to
                  the simulations does not appear to have made a large
                  impact on the angular momentum results compared to
                  these other studies, nor do we find that running an
                  identical simulation with significantly lower mass
                  resolution affects this aspect (although we are
                  unable to test higher mass resolution, which other
                  authors have shown can alleviate the
                  problem). Despite this, we can profitably use the
                  rank order of either disc-to-total ratio, Sersic
                  index, or galaxy age to separate galaxies into
                  morphological classes and examine the
                  density-morphology relation and morphology
                  dependence of clustering.  We find that while at
                  redshift z = 0 the well-known preponderance of early
                  types in dense environments is seen, at z = 1 the
                  density-morphology relation becomes flatter and
                  late-type galaxies are even seen to have a higher
                  clustering amplitude than early types.},

                  correlation between galaxy ellipticities arising
                  during the galaxy formation process may account for
                  part of the shear signal recently reported by
                  several groups engaged in weak gravitational lensing
                  surveys. Using high-resolution N-body simulations,
                  we measure the projected ellipticities of dark
                  matter halos and their correlations as a function of
                  pair separation.  With this simplifying, but not
                  necessarily realistic, assumption (halo shapes as a
                  proxy for galaxy shapes), we find a positive
                  detection of correlations up to scales of at least
                  20 h-1 Mpc (limited by the box size). The signal is
                  not strongly affected by variations in the
                  halo-finding technique, or by the resolution of the
                  simulations (over the range tested). We translate
                  our three-dimensional results into angular
                  measurements of ellipticity correlation functions
                  and shear variance, which can be directly compared
                  to observational results.  We also make simulated
                  angular surveys by projecting our simulation boxes
                  onto the plane of the sky and applying a radial
                  selection function.  Measurements from these
                  catalogs are consistent with the analytic projection
                  of the statistics. Interestingly, the shear variance
                  we measure is a small, but not entirely negligible,
                  fraction (from ~10-20 percent, depending on the angular
                  scale) of that seen by the observational groups, and
                  the ellipticity correlation functions approximately
                  mimic the functional form expected to be caused by
                  weak lensing. The amplitude of these projected
                  quantities depends strongly on the width in redshift
                  of the galaxy distribution. If in the future
                  photometric redshifts are used to pick out a screen
                  of background galaxies with a small redshift width,
                  then the intrinsic correlation may become comparable
                  to the weak-lensing signal. Although we are dealing
                  with simulated dark matter halos, we might expect
                  there to be a similar sort of signal when real
                  galaxies are used. This could be checked fruitfully
                  using a nearby sample with known redshifts.},

                  spiral galaxies around voids using galaxy redshift

                  of this alignment, showing how it falls off with
                  increasing distance to the centre of the void. We

                  (CDM) halos in a ΛCDM universe is
                  investigated. Their dimensionless specific angular
                  momentum λ'=j/(sqrt(2)VvirRvir) with Vvir and Rvir
                  the virial velocity and virial radius, respectively,
                  depends strongly on their merging histories. We
                  investigate a set of ΛCDM simulations and explore
                  the specific angular momentum content of halos
                  formed through various merging histories. Halos with
                  a quiet merging history, dominated by minor mergers
                  and accretion until the present epoch, acquire by
                  tidal torques on average only 2-3 percent of the angular
                  momentum required for their rotational support
                  (λ'=0.02). This is in conflict with observational
                  data for a sample of late-type bulgeless galaxies
                  that indicates that those galaxies reside in dark
                  halos with exceptionally high values of
                  λ'~0.06-0.07. Minor mergers and accretion preserve
                  or slowly increase the specific angular momentum of
                  dark halos with time. This mechanism, however, is
                  not efficient enough in order to explain the
                  observed spin values for late-type dwarf
                  galaxies. Energetic feedback processes have been
                  invoked to solve the problem that gas loses a large
                  fraction of its specific angular momentum during
                  infall.  Under the assumption that dark halos
                  hosting bulgeless galaxies acquire their mass via
                  quiescent accretion, our results indicate yet
                  another serious problem: the specific angular
                  momentum gained during the formation of these
                  objects is not large enough to explain their
                  observed rotational properties, even if no angular
                  momentum would be lost during gas infall.},

                  high-redshift dark matter haloes in an N-body
                  simulation. We find that the majority of collapsed,
                  bound haloes are not virialized at any redshift
                  slice in our study (z= 15 - 6) and have excess
                  kinetic energy. At these redshifts, merging is still
                  rampant and the haloes cannot strictly be treated as
                  isolated systems. To assess if this excess kinetic
                  energy arises from the environment, we include the
                  surface pressure term in the virial equation
                  explicitly and relax the assumption that the density
                  at the halo boundary is zero. Upon inclusion of the
                  surface term, we find that the haloes are much
                  closer to virialization; however, they still have
                  some excess kinetic energy. We report trends of the
                  virial ratio including the extra surface term with
                  three key halo properties: spin, environment and
                  concentration. We find that haloes with closer
                  neighbours depart more from virialization and that
                  haloes with larger spin parameters do as well. We
                  conclude that except at the lowest masses (M < 106
                  Msun), dark matter haloes at high redshift are not
                  fully virialized. This finding has interesting
                  implications for galaxy formation at these high
                  redshifts, as the excess kinetic energy will impact
                  the subsequent collapse of baryons and the formation
                  of the first discs and/or baryonic structures.},

                  horizontal branch and the turnoff in two internally
                  photometrically homogeneous databases. The mutual
                  consistency of the two data sets has been assessed
                  by comparing the ages of 16 globular clusters in
                  common between the two databases. We have also
                  investigated the consistency of our relative age
                  determination within the recent stellar model
                  framework. All clusters with [Fe/H]<-1.7 are found
                  to be old and coeval, with the possible exception of
                  two objects, which are marginally younger. The age
                  dispersion for the metal-poor clusters is 0.6 Gyr
                  (rms), consistent with a null age
                  dispersion. Intermediate-metallicity clusters
                  (-1.7<[Fe/H]<-0.8) are on average 1.5 Gyr younger
                  than the metal-poor ones, with an age dispersion of
                  1.0 Gyr (rms) and a total age range of ~3 Gyr. About
                  15 percent of the intermediate-metallicity clusters are
                  coeval with the oldest clusters. All the clusters
                  with [Fe/H]>-0.8 are ~1 Gyr younger than the most
                  metal-poor ones, with a relatively small age
                  dispersion, although the metal-rich sample is still
                  too small to allow firmer conclusions. There is no
                  correlation of the cluster age with the
                  galactocentric distance. We briefly discuss the

                  (core dominated) and cold dark matter (CDM; cusp
                  dominated) halos for a wide variety of assumptions
                  about the stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find that
                  the pseudoisothermal model provides superior
                  fits. CDM fits show systematic deviations from the
                  data and often have a small statistical likelihood
                  of being the appropriate model.  The distribution of
                  concentration parameters is too broad, and has too
                  low a mean, to be explained by low-density, flat CDM
                  (ΛCDM).  This failing becomes more severe as
                  increasing allowance is made for stellar mass:
                  Navarro, Frenk, & White (NFW) model fits require
                  uncomfortably low mass-to-light ratios. In contrast,

                  predicting the inner shape of the rotation curves,
                  but it requires uncomfortably large stellar
                  mass-to-light ratios. The data do admit reasonable
                  stellar population mass-to-light ratios if halos

                  bands from CTIO/MOSAIC of the Sculptor dwarf
                  spheroidal galaxy, going down to the oldest Main
                  Sequence Turn-Offs, with spectroscopic metallicity
                  distributions of Red Giant Branch stars. This allows
                  us to obtain the most detailed and complete Star
                  Formation History to date, as well as an accurate
                  timescale for chemical enrichment. The Star
                  Formation History shows that Sculptor is dominated
                  by old ($>$10 Gyr), metal-poor stars, but that
                  younger, more metal-rich populations are also
                  present. Using Star Formation Histories determined
                  at different radii from the centre we show that
                  Sculptor formed stars with an increasing central
                  concentration with time. The old, metal-poor
                  populations are present at all radii, while more
                  metal-rich, younger stars are more centrally
                  concentrated.  We find that within an elliptical
                  radius of 1 degree, or 1.5 kpc from the centre, a
                  total mass in stars of 7.8$\times10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$
                  was formed, between 14 and 7 Gyr ago, with a peak at
                  13$-$14 Gyr ago. We use the detailed Star Formation
                  History to determine age estimates for individual
                  Red Giant Branch stars with high resolution
                  spectroscopic abundances. Thus, for the first time,
                  we can directly determine detailed timescales for
                  the evolution of individual chemical elements. We
                  find that the trends in alpha-elements match what is
                  expected from an extended, relatively uninterrupted
                  period of star formation continuing for 6$-$7
                  Gyr. The knee in the alpha-element distribution
                  occurs at an age of 10.9$\pm$1Gyr, suggesting that
                  SNe Ia enrichment began $\approx2\pm$1Gyr after the
                  start of star formation in Sculptor.},

                  from CTIO/MOSAIC for about 270.000 stars in the
                  Fornax dwarf Spheroidal galaxy, out to a radius of
                  r_ell\sim0.8 degrees. By combining the accurately
                  calibrated photometry with the spectroscopic
                  metallicity distributions of individual Red Giant
                  Branch stars we obtain the detailed star formation
                  and chemical evolution history of Fornax. Fornax is
                  dominated by intermediate age (1-10 Gyr) stellar
                  populations, but also includes ancient (10-14 Gyr),
                  and young (<1 Gyr) stars. We show that Fornax
                  displays a radial age gradient, with younger, more
                  metal-rich populations dominating the central
                  region. This confirms results from previous
                  works. Within an elliptical radius of 0.8 degrees,
                  or 1.9 kpc from the centre, a total mass in stars of
                  4.3x10^7 Msun was formed, from the earliest times
                  until 250 Myr ago. Using the detailed star formation
                  history, age estimates are determined for individual
                  stars on the upper RGB, for which spectroscopic
                  abundances are available, giving an age-metallicity
                  relation of the Fornax dSph from individual stars.
                  This shows that the average metallicity of Fornax
                  went up rapidly from [Fe/H]<-2.5 dex to [Fe/H]=-1.5
                  dex between 8-12 Gyr ago, after which a more gradual
                  enrichment resulted in a narrow, well-defined
                  sequence which reaches [Fe/H]\sim-0.8 dex, \sim3 Gyr
                  ago. These ages also allow us to measure the
                  build-up of chemical elements as a function of time,
                  and thus determine detailed timescales for the
                  evolution of individual chemical elements. A rapid
                  decrease in [Mg/Fe] is seen for the stars with
                  [Fe/H]>-1.5 dex, with a clear trend in age.},

                  high-resolution numerical simulations of the
                  formation of structure in a ΛCDM universe. Our
                  simulation set includes 11 high-resolution
                  simulations of massive clusters as well as a region
                  of mean density, allowing us to study the spatial
                  and mass distribution of substructures down to a
                  mass resolution limit of 109h-1 Msolar. We also
                  investigate how the properties of substructures vary
                  as a function of the mass of the `parent' halo in
                  which they are located. We find that the
                  substructure mass function depends at most weakly on
                  the mass of the parent halo and is well described by
                  a power law. The radial number density profiles of
                  substructures are steeper in low mass haloes than in
                  high-mass haloes. More massive substructures tend to
                  avoid the centres of haloes and are preferentially
                  located in the external regions of their parent
                  haloes. We also study the mass accretion and merging
                  histories of substructures, which we find to be
                  largely independent of environment. We find that a
                  significant fraction of the substructures residing
                  in clusters at the present day were accreted at
                  redshifts z < 1. This implies that a significant
                  fraction of present-day `passive' cluster galaxies
                  were still outside the cluster progenitor and were
                  more active at z~ 1.},

                  simulations of major galaxy mergers with new
                  implementations of BH accretion and feedback. The
                  effect of BH accretion on gas in its host galaxy is
                  modelled by depositing momentum at the rate of ˜τL/c
                  into the ambient gas, where L is the luminosity
                  produced by accretion on to the BH and τ is the
                  wavelength-averaged optical depth of the galactic
                  nucleus to the AGN’s radiation (a free parameter of
                  our model). The accretion rate on to the BH is
                  relatively independent of our subgrid accretion
                  model and is instead determined by the BH’s
                  dynamical impact on its host galaxy: BH accretion is
                  thus self-regulated rather than ‘supply limited’. We
                  show that the final BH mass and total stellar mass
                  formed during a merger are more robust predictions
                  of the simulations than the time dependence of the
                  star formation rate or BH accretion rate. In
                  particular, the latter depend on the assumed
                  interstellar medium physics, which determines when
                  and where the gas fragments to form star clusters;
                  this in turn affects the fuel available for further
                  star formation and BH growth.  Simulations over a
                  factor of ˜30 in galaxy mass are consistent with the
                  observed MBH-σ relation for a mean optical depth of
                  τ˜ 25. This requires that most BH growth occur when
                  the galactic nucleus is optically thick to
                  far-infrared radiation, consistent with the
                  hypothesized connection between ultraluminous
                  infrared galaxies and quasars. We find tentative
                  evidence for a shallower MBH-σ relation in the

                  Constrained Local UniversE Simulations (CLUES) of

                  density profile of subhaloes of the simulated Milky
                  Way and Andromeda galaxies. We show that the Einasto
                  model provides the best description of the
                  subhaloes' density profile, as opposed to the more
                  commonly used NFW profile or any generalisation of
                  it.  We further find that the Einasto shape
                  parameter \nEin\ is strongly correlated with the
                  total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of a
                  non-universality of the subhaloes' density
                  profile. Assuming now that the dSphs of our Galaxy
                  thus follow the Einasto profile and using the
                  maximum and minimum values of \nEin\ from our SPH
                  simulations as a gauge, we can improve the
                  observational constraints on the \Rmax-\Vmax\ pairs
                  obtained for the brightest satellite galaxies of the
                  Milky Way. When considering only the subhaloes with
                  $-13.2\lesssim M_V\lesssim-8.8$, i.e. the range of
                  luminosity of the classical dwarfs, we find that all
                  our simulated objects are consistent with the
                  observed dSphs if their haloes follow the Einasto
                  model with $1.6\lesssim n_{\rm E} \lesssim5.3$. The
                  numerically motivated Einasto profile for the
                  observed dSphs as well as the observationally
                  motivated magnitude cut for the simulated subhaloes
                  will eliminate the "massive failures" problem and
                  results in a perfect agreement with observations.},

                  and before z= 4.4 even 3 × 105 Msolar. This is a

                  simulations. We achieve this resolution using a new

                  probe a dark matter halo density profile down to 0.1
                  per cent of the virial radius. The inner density
                  profile of this cluster halo is well fitted by a

                  Milky Way-sized halo with Mhalo=1.8×1012 Msolar in a
                  WMAP three-year cosmology, using 234 million
                  particles. Over 10,000 subhalos can be identified at
                  z=0: their cumulative mass function is well-fit by
                  N(>Msub)=0.0064(Msub/Mhalo)-1 down to Msub=4×106
                  Msolar. The total mass fraction in subhalos is 5.3 percent,
                  while the fraction of surface mass density in
                  substructure within a projected distance of 10 kpc
                  from the halo center is 0.3 percent. Because of the
                  significant contribution from the smallest resolved
                  subhalos, these fractions have not converged
                  yet. Sub-substructure is apparent in all the larger
                  satellites, and a few dark matter lumps are resolved
                  even in the solar vicinity.  The number of dark
                  satellites with peak circular velocities above 10 km
                  s-1 (5 km s-1) is 124 (812): of these, five (26) are
                  found within 0.1rvir, a region that appeared
                  practically smooth in previous simulations. The
                  neutralino self-annihilation γ-ray emission from
                  dark matter clumps is approximately constant per
                  subhalo mass decade.  Therefore, while in our run
                  the contribution of substructure to the γ-ray
                  luminosity of the Galactic halo amounts to only 40 percent
                  of the total spherically averaged smooth signal, we
                  expect this fraction to grow significantly as
                  resolution is increased further. An all-sky map of
                  the expected annihilation γ-ray flux reaching a
                  fiducial observer at 8 kpc from the Galactic center
                  shows that at the current resolution a small number
                  of subhalos start to be bright enough to be visible
                  against the background from the smooth density field
                  surrounding the observer.},

                  simulations use from 30,000 to 300,000 particles,
                  which allow density profiles and shapes to be well
                  resolved. The core radius of a typical dark halo is
                  found to be no greater than the softening radius,
                  epsilon = 1.4 kpc. The density profiles can be
                  fitted with an analytical model with an effective
                  power law which varies between -1 in the center to
                  -4 at large radii. The dark halos have circular
                  velocity curves which behave like the circular
                  velocity contribution of the dark component of
                  spiral galaxies inferred from rotation curve
                  decompositions. The halos are strongly triaxial and
                  very flat, with (c/a) = 0.50 and (b/a) = 0.71. There
                  are roughly equal numbers of dark halos with oblate
                  and prolate forms. The distribution of ellipticities
                  in projection for dark halos reaches a maximum at
                  epsilon = 0.5, in contrast to the ellipticity
                  distribution of elliptical galaxies, which peaks at
                  epsilon = 0.2.},

  abstract =     {We use a semi-analytic model for disk galaxies to
                  explore the origin of the time evolution and small
                  scatter of the galaxy SFR sequence - the tight
                  correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and
                  stellar mass (Mstar). The steep decline of SFR from
                  z ~ 2 to the present, at fixed Mstar, is a
                  consequence of the following. First, disk galaxies
                  are in a steady state with the SFR following the net
                  (i.e. inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. The
                  evolution of the SFR sequence is determined by
                  evolution in the cosmological specific accretion
                  rates, ~ (1 + z)2.25, but is found to be independent
                  of feedback.  Although feedback determines the
                  outflow rates, it shifts galaxies along the SFR
                  sequence, leaving its zero-point invariant. Second,
                  the conversion of accretion rate to SFR is
                  materialized through gas density, not gas
                  mass. Although the model SFR is an increasing
                  function of both gas mass fraction and gas density,
                  only the gas densities are predicted to evolve
                  significantly with redshift. Third, star formation
                  is fueled by molecular gas. Since the molecular gas
                  fraction increases monotonically with increasing gas
                  density, the model predicts strong evolution in the
                  molecular gas fractions, increasing by an order of
                  magnitude from z = 0 to z ~ 2. On the other hand,
                  the model predicts that the effective surface
                  density of atomic gas is , independent of redshift,
                  stellar mass or feedback. Our model suggests that
                  the scatter in the SFR sequence reflects variations
                  in the gas accretion history, and thus is
                  insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback.
                  The large scatter in halo spin contributes
                  negligibly, because it scatters galaxies along the
                  SFR sequence. An observational consequence of this
                  is that the scatter in the SFR sequence is
                  independent of the size (both stellar and gaseous)
                  of galaxy disks.},

                  and optical half-light radius of star-forming
                  disc-dominated galaxies in the context of Λ cold
                  dark matter-based galaxy formation models. Using
                  data from the literature combined with new data from
                  the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2)
                  and All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip
                  International Survey (AEGIS) surveys, we show that
                  there is a consistent picture for the evolution of
                  these scaling relations from z˜ 2 to z= 0, both
                  observationally and theoretically. The evolution of
                  the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker
                  than that of the virial scaling relations of dark
                  matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both
                  qualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple,
                  cosmologically motivated model for disc evolution
                  inside growing Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter
                  haloes.  In this model optical half-light radii are
                  smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and at maximum
                  circular velocity, at higher redshifts.  This model
                  also predicts that the scaling relations between
                  baryonic quantities (baryonic mass, baryonic
                  half-mass radii and maximum circular velocity)
                  evolve even more weakly than the corresponding
                  stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this
                  weak evolution does not imply that individual
                  galaxies evolve weakly. On the contrary, individual
                  galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity
                  but in such a way that they move largely along the
                  scaling relations. Finally, recent observations have
                  claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of
                  star-forming disc galaxies at z≃ 2, which has caused
                  some authors to suggest that high-redshift disc
                  galaxies have abnormally high spin
                  parameters. However, we argue that the disc
                  scalelengths in question have been systematically
                  overestimated by a factor of ˜2 and that there is an
                  offset of a factor of ˜1.4 between Hα sizes and
                  optical sizes. Taking these effects into account,
                  there is no indication that star-forming galaxies at
                  high redshifts (z≃ 2) have abnormally high spin
                  parameters.},

  abstract =     {Aims: We present the results of the study of the
                  substructure and galaxy content of ten rich clusters
                  of galaxies in three different superclusters of the
                  Sloan great wall, the richest nearby system of
                  galaxies (hereafter SGW).  Methods: We determine the
                  substructure in clusters using the “Mclust” package
                  from the “R” statistical environment and analyse
                  their galaxy content with information about colours
                  and morphological types of galaxies. We analyse the
                  distribution of the peculiar velocities of galaxies
                  in clusters and calculate the peculiar velocity of
                  the first ranked galaxy.  Results: We show that five
                  clusters in our sample have more than one component;
                  in some clusters the different components also have
                  different galaxy content. In other clusters there
                  are distinct components in the distribution of the
                  peculiar velocities of galaxies. We find that in
                  some clusters with substructure the peculiar
                  velocities of the first ranked galaxies are
                  high. All clusters in our sample host luminous red
                  galaxies; in eight clusters their number exceeds
                  ten.  Luminous red galaxies can be found both in the
                  central areas of clusters and in the outskirts, some
                  of them have high peculiar velocities.  About 1/3 of
                  the red galaxies in clusters are spirals. The
                  scatter of colours of red ellipticals is in most
                  clusters larger than that of red spirals. The
                  fraction of red galaxies in rich clusters in the
                  cores of the richest superclusters is larger than
                  the fraction of red galaxies in other very rich
                  clusters in the SGW.  Conclusions: The presence of
                  substructure in rich clusters, signs of possible
                  mergers and infall, and the high peculiar velocities
                  of the first ranked galaxies suggest that the
                  clusters in our sample are not yet virialized. We
                  present merger trees of dark matter haloes in an
                  N-body simulation to demonstrate the formation of
                  present-day dark matter haloes via multiple mergers
                  during their evolution. In simulated dark matter
                  haloes we find a substructure similar to that in
                  observed clusters.},

  abstract =     {We describe a new method (HOP) for identifying
                  groups of particles in N-body simulations. Having
                  assigned to every particle an estimate of its local
                  density, we associate each particle with the densest
                  of the Nhop particles nearest to it. Repeating this
                  process allows us to trace a path, within the
                  particle set itself, from each particle in the
                  direction of increasing density. The path ends when
                  it reaches a particle that is its own densest
                  neighbor; all particles reaching the same such
                  particle are identified as a group. Combined with an
                  adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities,
                  this method is spatially adaptive, coordinate-free,
                  and numerically straightforward.  One can proceed to
                  process the output by truncating groups at a
                  particular density contour and combining groups that
                  share a (possibly different) density contour. While
                  the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen
                  parameters, we show that the results are insensitive
                  to most of these, the exception being the outer
                  density cutoff of the groups.},

                  predict that halos should form with a diverging
                  inner density profile, the cusp. There are some
                  observational indications that the dark matter
                  distribution in galaxies might be characterized by a
                  finite core. This ``core catastrophe'' has prompted
                  a search for alternatives to the cold dark matter
                  (CDM) cosmogony. It is shown here that the
                  discrepancy between theory and observations can be
                  very naturally resolved within the standard CDM
                  model, provided that gas is not initially smoothly
                  distributed in the dark matter halo but rather is
                  concentrated in clumps of mass >=0.01 percent of the total
                  mass of the system. Dynamical friction acting on
                  these lumps moving in the background of the dark
                  matter particles dissipates the clumps' orbital
                  energy and deposits it in the dark matter. Using
                  Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the
                  dynamical friction provides a strong enough drag and
                  that with realistic baryonic mass fractions, the
                  available orbital energy of the clumps is sufficient
                  to heat the halo and turn the primordial cusp into a
                  finite, nondiverging core-overcoming the competing
                  effect of adiabatic contraction due to the
                  gravitational influence of the shrinking baryonic
                  component.  Depending on the initial conditions, the
                  total density distribution may become either more or
                  less centrally concentrated. Possible consequences
                  of the proposed mechanism for other problems in the
                  CDM model and for the formation and early evolution
                  of the baryonic component of galaxies are also

                  spheroidal galaxies in nearby clusters of galaxies
                  provides a powerful constraint on the history of
                  star formation in dense environments. However, with
                  local data alone, it is not possible to separate
                  models where galaxies assembled synchronously over
                  redshifts 0 < z < 1 from ones where galaxies formed
                  stochastically at much earlier times. Here we
                  attempt to resolve this ambiguity via high-precision
                  rest-frame UV--optical photometry of a large sample
                  of morphologically selected spheroidal galaxies in
                  three z ~ 0.54 clusters that have been observed with
                  the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We demonstrate the
                  robustness of using the HST to conduct the
                  morphological separation of spheroidal and disk
                  galaxies at this redshift and use our new data to
                  repeat the analysis conducted locally at a
                  significant look-back time. We find a small scatter
                  (<0.1 mag rms) for galaxies classed as E's and
                  E/S0's, both internally within each of the three
                  clusters and externally from cluster to cluster. We
                  do not find any trend for the scatter to increase
                  with decreasing luminosity down to L~L^{*}V+3 ,
                  other than can be accounted for by observational
                  error. Neither is there evidence for a distinction
                  between the scatter observed for galaxies classified
                  as ellipticals and S0. Our result provides a new
                  constraint on the star formation history of cluster
                  spheroidals prior to z ~= 0.5 confirming and
                  considerably strengthening the earlier conclusions.
                  Most of the star formation in the elliptical
                  galaxies in dense clusters was completed before z ~=
                  3 in conventional cosmologies. Although we cannot
                  rule out the continued production of some
                  ellipticals, our results do indicate an era of
                  initial star formation consistent with the
                  population of star-forming galaxies recently
                  detected beyond z ~= 3.},

                  arcseconds of a star. Current and near-future
                  instruments could detect this signal, and we
                  evaluate the Space Interferometry Mission's (SIM's),
                  Gaia's, and ground-based telescopes' potential as
                  subhalo detectors. We develop a general formalism to
                  calculate a subhalo's astrometric lensing cross
                  section over a wide range of masses and density
                  profiles, and we calculate the lensing event rate by
                  extrapolating the subhalo mass function predicted by
                  simulations down to the subhalo masses potentially
                  detectable with this technique.  We find that,
                  although the detectable event rates are predicted to
                  be low on the basis of current simulations, lensing
                  events may be observed if the central regions of
                  dark matter subhalos are more dense than current
                  models predict (gsim1 M sun within 0.1 pc of the
                  subhalo center). Furthermore, targeted astrometric
                  observations can be used to confirm the presence of
                  a nearby subhalo detected by gamma-ray emission. We
                  show that, for sufficiently steep density profiles,
                  ground-based adaptive optics astrometric techniques
                  could be capable of detecting intermediate-mass
                  subhalos at distances of hundreds of parsecs, while
                  SIM could detect smaller and more distant subhalos.},

                  500 h-1 Mpc base length for a standard Lambda CDM
                  model. Employing the technique of mark correlation
                  functions, we successfully separated the
                  correlations in the orientation from the well known
                  clustering signal traced by the two-point
                  correlation function. The correlations in the
                  orientation are highly significant for our sample of
                  3000 clusters. We found an alignment of neighboring
                  clusters, i.e. an enhanced probability of the major
                  elongation axes of neighboring cluster pairs to be
                  in parallel with each other. At 10 h-1 Mpc
                  separation the amplitude of this signal is ~ 10 percent
                  above the value expected from random orientations,
                  and it vanishes on scales larger than 15 h-1
                  Mpc. The ``filamentary'' alignment between clusters'
                  major elongation axes and the lines pointing towards
                  neighboring clusters shows even stronger deviations
                  from random orientation, which can be detected out
                  to scales of 100 h-1 Mpc, both in 2D and 3D
                  analyses. Similarly, strong correlations of the
                  angular momentum were seen. Also a clear signal in

                  angular momentum, the spin parameter and the mass
                  was found. They extend up to 50 h-1 Mpc and have an
                  amplitude of 40, 15, and 10 percent above a random
                  distribution at 10 h-1 Mpc separation,

                  satellites, however, are perfectly consistent with

  abstract =     {Based on a cosmological N-body simulation, we
                  analyze spatial and kinematic alignments of
                  satellite halos within 6 times the virial radius of
                  group-sized host halos (rvir). We measure three
                  different types of spatial alignment: halo alignment
                  between the orientation of the group central
                  substructure (GCS) and the distribution of its
                  satellites, radial alignment between the orientation
                  of a satellite and the direction toward its GCS, and
                  direct alignment between the orientation of the GCS
                  and that of its satellites. Analogously, we use the
                  directions of satellite velocities and probe three
                  further types of alignment: the radial velocity
                  alignment between the satellite velocity and the
                  connecting line between the satellite and GCS, the
                  halo velocity alignment between the orientation of
                  the GCS and satellite velocities, and the
                  autovelocity alignment between the satellite
                  orientations and their velocities. We find that
                  satellites are preferentially located along the
                  major axis of the GCS within at least 6rvir (the
                  range probed here). Furthermore, satellites
                  preferentially point toward the GCS. The most
                  pronounced signal is detected on small scales, but a
                  detectable signal extends out to ~6rvir. The direct
                  alignment signal is weaker; however, a systematic
                  trend is visible at distances <~2rvir. All velocity
                  alignments are highly significant on small
                  scales. The halo velocity alignment is constant
                  within 2rvir and declines rapidly beyond. The halo
                  and the autovelocity alignments are maximal at small
                  scales and disappear beyond 1rvir and 1.5rvir,
                  respectively. Our results suggest that the halo
                  alignment reflects the filamentary large-scale
                  structure that extends far beyond the virial radii
                  of the groups. In contrast, the main contribution to
                  the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of
                  the satellite orientations in the group tidal
                  field. The projected data reveal good agreement with
                  recent results derived from large galaxy surveys.},

                  passively evolving galaxies at redshifts z >~ 1
                  exhibit on average physical sizes smaller, by
                  factors 3, than local early-type galaxies (ETGs)
                  endowed with the same stellar mass. Small sizes are
                  in fact expected on theoretical grounds, if
                  dissipative collapse occurs. Recent results show
                  that the size evolution at z <~ 1 is limited to less
                  than 40 percent, while most of the evolution occurs at z >
                  1, where both compact and already extended galaxies
                  are observed and the scatter in size is remarkably
                  larger than it is locally. The presence at high
                  redshift of a significant number of ETGs with the
                  same size as their local counterparts, as well as
                  ETGs with quite small size (lsim1/10 of the local
                  one), points to a timescale for reaching the new,
                  expanded equilibrium configuration of less than the
                  Hubble time tH (z). We demonstrate that the
                  projected mass of compact, high-redshift galaxies
                  and that of local ETGs within the same physical
                  radius, the nominal half-luminosity radius of
                  high-redshift ETGs, differ substantially in that the
                  high-redshift ETGs are on average significantly
                  denser. This result suggests that the physical
                  mechanism responsible for the size increase should
                  also remove mass from central galaxy regions (r <~ 1
                  kpc). We propose that quasar activity, which peaks
                  at redshift z ~ 2, can remove large amounts of gas
                  from central galaxy regions on a timescale shorter
                  than the triggering a puffing up of the stellar
                  component at constant stellar mass (or a timescale
                  on the order of the dynamical one); in this case,
                  the size increase goes together with a decrease in
                  the central mass. The size evolution is expected to
                  parallel that of the quasars and the inverse
                  hierarchy, or downsizing, seen in the quasar
                  evolution is mirrored in the size
                  evolution. Exploiting the virial theorem, we derive
                  the relation between the stellar velocity dispersion
                  of ETGs and the characteristic velocity of their
                  hosting halos at the time of formation and
                  collapse. By combining this relation with the halo
                  formation rate at z >~ 1, we predict the local
                  velocity dispersion distribution function. On
                  comparing it to the observed one, we show that
                  velocity dispersion evolution of massive ETGs is
                  fully compatible with the observed average evolution
                  in size at constant stellar mass.  Less massive ETGs
                  (with stellar masses M sstarf <~ 3 × 1010 M sun) are
                  expected to evolve less both in size and in velocity
                  dispersion, because their evolution is essentially
                  determined by supernova feedback, which cannot yield
                  winds as powerful as those triggered by quasars.
                  The differential evolution is expected to leave
                  imprints in the size versus luminosity/mass,
                  velocity dispersion versus luminosity/mass, and
                  central black hole mass versus velocity dispersion
                  relationships, as observed in local ETGs.},

  abstract =     {The distribution of dark matter around galactic or
                  cluster halos has usually been assumed to be
                  approximately isothermal with a nonzero core radius,
                  which is expected to be of the order of the size of
                  the visible matter distribution. Recently, the
                  possibility has been raised that dark matter halos
                  might be singular, in the sense that the dark matter
                  density p could increase monotonically with radius r
                  down to a very small distance from the center of
                  galaxies or clusters.  Such central cusps in the
                  dark matter density could lead to a high flux of
                  gamma rays from weakly interacting, massive particle
                  (WIMP) dark matter annihilation. Here we analyze two
                  possibilities that have been discussed in the
                  literature, rho varies as r-n, with n approximately
                  equals 1 or 2, and point out that such density
                  profiles are exluded by gravitational lensing
                  analyses on cluster scales and by the rotation
                  curves of gas-rich, halo-diminated dwarf spirals on
                  small scales. We also point out that if spiral
                  galaxies form by gas infall inside dark matter
                  halos, as they are expected to do in any
                  hierarchical clustering model, such profiles almost
                  always lead to falling rotation curves after infall,
                  contrary to observations.},

                  gas is considered in the framework of Friedmann
                  cosmological models from redshift z=10(4) to
                  z=0. First, a comprehensive analysis of 87 gas phase
                  reaction rates (both collisional and radiative)
                  relevant in the physical environment of the
                  expanding universe is presented and critically
                  discussed.  On this basis, calculations are carried
                  out of the abundance of 21 molecular species as
                  function of redshift, for different values of the
                  cosmological parameters Omega_0 , eta and H_0,
                  evaluating consistently the molecular heating and
                  cooling due to H_2, HD and LiH molecules.  One of
                  the major improvements of this work is the use of a
                  better treatment of H recombination that leads to a
                  reduction of a factor 2-3 in the abundance of
                  electrons and H(+) at freeze-out, with respect to
                  previous studies. The lower residual ionization has
                  a negative effect on the chemistry of the primordial
                  gas in which electrons and protons act as catalysts
                  in the formation of the first molecules.  We find
                  that in the standard model (h=0.67, eta_ {10}=4.5,
                  Omega_0 =1 and [D/H] =4.3x 10(-5) ), the residual
                  fractional ionization at z=1 is [e/H]=3.02x 10(-4) ,
                  and the main molecular species fractional abundances
                  [H_2/H]=1.1x 10(-6) , [HD/H_2]=1.1x 10(-3) ,
                  [HeH(+/) H]=6.2x 10(-13) , [LiH(+/) H]=9.4x 10(-18)
                  and [LiH/LiH(+]=7.6x) 10(-3) . We devise a reduced
                  chemical network that reproduces with excellent
                  accuracy the numerical results of the complete model
                  and allows to follow the chemical compositions and
                  the thermal properties of a primordial gas in the
                  presence of an external radiation field.  Finally,
                  we provide accurate cooling functions of H_2, HD and
                  LiH in a wide range of density and temperature that
                  can be conveniently used in a variety of

                  as dynamical friction, tidal stripping and tidal
                  heating. We find that in order to best match the
                  evolution of angular momentum measured from N-body
                  simulation, mass stripping by tidal force should
                  become inefficient after subhalo has experienced a
                  few passages of pericentre. It is also found that
                  the often used Coulomb logarithm ln M/m has to be
                  revised to best fit the merging time-scales from
                  simulation. Combining the analytical model with the
                  extended Press-Schechter (EPS) based merger trees,
                  we study the subhalo mass function, and their
                  spatial distribution in a Milky Way (MW) type
                  halo. By tuning the tidal stripping efficiency, we
                  can gain a better match to the subhalo mass function
                  from simulation. The predicted distribution of
                  subhaloes is found to agree with the distribution of
                  MW satellites, but is more concentrated than the
                  simulation results. The radial distribution of
                  subhaloes depends weakly on subhaloes mass at both
                  present day and the time of accretion, but strongly
                  on the accretion time. Using the improved model, we
                  measure the second moment of the subhalo occupation
                  distribution, and it agrees well with the results of
                  Kravtsov et al. and Zheng et al.},

                  matter density ρdm from the vertical motion of stars
                  in the solar neighbourhood.  Using a simulation of a
                  Milky Way like galaxy, we determine the data quality
                  required to detect ρdm at its expected local
                  value. We introduce a new method for recovering ρdm
                  that uses moments of the Jeans equations, combined
                  with a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, to
                  marginalize over the unknown parameters. Given
                  sufficiently good data, we show that our method can
                  recover the correct local dark matter density even
                  in the face of disc inhomogeneities, non-isothermal
                  tracers and a non-separable distribution
                  function. We illustrate the power of our technique
                  by applying it to Hipparcos data. We first make the
                  assumption that the A- and F-star tracer populations
                  are isothermal.  This recovers ρdm= 0.003+0.009-
                  0.007 Msun pc-3 (ρdm= 0.11+0.34- 0.27 GeV cm-3, with
                  90 per cent confidence), consistent with previous
                  determinations. However, the vertical dispersion
                  profile of these tracers is poorly known. If we
                  assume instead a non-isothermal profile similar to
                  that of the blue disc stars from SDSS DR-7 recently
                  measured, we obtain a fit with a very similar χ2
                  value, but with ρdm= 0.033+0.008- 0.009 Msun pc-3
                  (ρdm= 1.25+0.30- 0.34 GeV cm-3 with 90 per cent
                  confidence).  This highlights that it is vital to
                  measure the vertical dispersion profile of the
                  tracers to recover an unbiased estimate of ρdm.},

                  well as a comparison of halo growth in
                  Press-Schechter versus N-body methods. A total of
                  six simulations are used, spanning three
                  cosmologies: a standard flat Ω0=1 model, an open
                  Ω0=0.3 model, and a ``tilted'' flat Ω0=1 model with
                  spectral index n=0.8. In each model, one run was
                  conducted using a spatially uniform grid of
                  particles and one using a refined grid in a large
                  void. In all three models and all environments
                  tested, the mean angular momentum of merger remnants
                  (halo interaction products with mass ratios 3:1 or
                  less) is greater than nonmerger
                  remnants. Furthermore, the dispersion in the
                  merger-remnant angular momentum distribution is
                  smaller than the dispersion of the nonmerger
                  distribution. The interpretation most consistent
                  with the data is that the orbital angular momentum
                  of the interactors is important in establishing the
                  final angular momentum of the merger product. I give
                  the angular momentum distribution, which describes
                  the merger remnant population. I trace the most
                  massive progenitor of L* galactic-mass halos
                  (uniform grid) and 1011 Msolar halos (refined void)
                  from z=0 back to z=5. Monte Carlo mass histories
                  match simulations reasonably well for the latter
                  sample. I find that for halos of mass 1012<~M<~1014
                  Msolar, this method can underestimate the mass of
                  progenitors by 20 percent, hence yielding improper
                  formation redshifts of halos. With this caveat,
                  however, the general shapes of halo mass histories
                  and formation time distributions are preserved.},

                  with the goal of providing an improved description
                  of galaxy clustering. Recent surveys, like the Sloan
                  Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Anglo-Australian
                  two-degree survey (2dF), have shown that there seems
                  to be a correlation between the clustering of
                  galaxies and their properties such as metallicity
                  and star formation rate, which are believed to be
                  environment-dependent.  This environmental
                  dependence is not included in the standard halo
                  model where the host halo mass is the only variable
                  specifying galaxy properties. In our approach, the
                  halo properties, i.e. the concentration, and the
                  halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescription,
                  will not only depend on the halo mass (like in the
                  standard halo model) but also on the halo
                  environment. We examine how different environmental
                  dependence of halo concentration and HOD
                  prescription affects the correlation function. We
                  see that at the level of dark matter, the
                  concentration of haloes moderately affects the dark
                  matter correlation function only at small
                  scales. However, the galaxy correlation function is
                  extremely sensitive to the HOD details, even when
                  only the HOD of a small fraction of haloes is
                  modified.},

  abstract =     {We describe our new `MLAPM halo finder' (MHF), which
                  is based on the adaptive grid structure of the
                  N-body code MLAPM. We then extend the MHF code in
                  order to track the orbital evolution of
                  gravitationally bound objects through any given
                  cosmological N-body simulation - our so-called
                  `MLAPM halo tracker' (MHT). The mode of operation of
                  MHT is demonstrated using a series of eight
                  high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy
                  clusters. Each of these haloes hosts more than one
                  million particles within their virial radii rvir. We
                  use MHT as well as MHF to follow the temporal
                  evolution of hundreds of individual satellites, and
                  show that the radial distribution of these
                  substructure satellites follows a `universal' radial
                  distribution irrespective of the environment and
                  formation history of the host halo. This in fact
                  might pose another problem for simulations of cold
                  dark matter structure formation, as there are recent
                  findings by Taylor, Silk & Babul that the Milky Way
                  satellites are found preferentially closer to the
                  Galactic Centre and simulations underestimate the
                  amount of central substructure. Further, this
                  universal substructure profile is anti-biased with
                  respect to the underlying dark matter profile.  The
                  halo finder MHF will become part of the open source
                  MLAPM distribution.},

  abstract =     {At low temperatures, the main coolant in primordial
                  gas is molecular hydrogen, H2. Recent work has shown
                  that primordial gas that is not collapsing
                  gravitationally but is cooling from an initially
                  ionized state forms hydrogen deuteride, HD, in
                  sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the
                  temperature of the cosmic microwave background. This
                  extra cooling can reduce the characteristic mass for
                  gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in
                  the characteristic masses of Population III
                  stars. Motivated by the importance of the atomic and
                  molecular data for the cosmological question, we
                  assess several chemical and radiative processes that
                  have hitherto been neglected: the sensitivity of the
                  low-temperature H2 cooling rate to the ratio of
                  ortho-H2 to para-H2, the uncertainty in the
                  low-temperature cooling rate of H2 excited by
                  collisions with atomic hydrogen, the effects of
                  cooling from H2 excited by collisions with protons
                  and electrons, and the large uncertainties in the
                  rates of several of the reactions responsible for
                  determining the H2 fraction in the gas.  It is shown
                  that the most important of neglected processes is
                  the excitation of H2 by collisions with protons and
                  electrons. Their effect is to cool the gas more
                  rapidly at early times, and consequently to form
                  less H2 and HD at late times. This fact, as well as
                  several of the chemical uncertainties presented
                  here, significantly affects the thermal evolution of
                  the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to clear
                  differences in future detailed three-dimensional
                  studies of first structure formation. In such
                  calculations it has previously been shown that the
                  details of the timing between cooling and merger
                  events decide between immediate runaway
                  gravitational collapse and a slower collapse delayed
                  by turbulent heating.  Finally, we show that
                  although the thermal evolution of the gas is in
                  principle sensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in
                  practice the standard assumption of a 3:1 ratio
                  produces results that are almost indistinguishable
                  from those produced by a more detailed treatment.},

  abstract =     {Cooling functions of cosmic gas are a crucial
                  ingredient for any study of gas dynamics and
                  thermodynamics in the interstellar and intergalactic
                  medium. As such, they have been studied extensively
                  in the past under the assumption of collisional
                  ionization equilibrium. However, for a wide range of
                  applications, the local radiation field introduces a
                  non-negligible, often dominant, modification to the
                  cooling and heating functions. In the most general
                  case, these modifications cannot be described in
                  simple terms, and would require a detailed
                  calculation with a large set of chemical species
                  using a radiative transfer code (the well-known code
                  Cloudy, for example). We show, however, that for a
                  sufficiently general variation in the spectral shape
                  and intensity of the incident radiation field, the
                  cooling and heating functions can be
                  \emph{approximated} as depending only on (1) the
                  photo-dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen, (2)
                  the hydrogen photo-ionization rate, and (3) the
                  photo-ionization rate of OVIII; more complex and
                  more accurate approximations also exist.  Such
                  dependence is easy to tabulate and implement in
                  cosmological or galactic-scale simulations, thus
                  economically accounting for an important but
                  rarely-included factor in the evolution of cosmic
                  gas.  We also show a few examples where the
                  radiation environment has a large effect, the most
                  spectacular of which is a quasar that suppresses gas
                  cooling in its host halo without any mechanical or

                  possible solution of this problem involves stellar
                  feedback. A strong baryonic wind driven by vigorous
                  star formation can remove a large fraction of the

                  has five globular clusters orbiting at ~1kpc from
                  its centre. In a cuspy cold dark matter halo the
                  globulars would sink to the centre from their
                  current positions within a few Gyr, presenting a
                  puzzle as to why they survive undigested at the
                  present epoch. We show that a solution to this
                  timing problem is to adopt a cored dark matter
                  halo. We use numerical simulations and analytic
                  calculations to show that, under these conditions,
                  the sinking time becomes many Hubble times; the
                  globulars effectively stall at the dark matter core

                  low-mass virialized clouds of primordial
                  composition.  While atomic cooling allows star
                  formation in objects with virial temperatures above
                  104 K, "minihalos" below this threshold are
                  generally unable to form stars by
                  themselves. However, these objects are highly
                  susceptible to triggered star formation, induced by
                  outflows from neighboring high-redshift starburst
                  galaxies. Here, we conduct a study of these

                  less than ≈106 M sun, and they are ejected from

                  based on data from the POWIR near-infrared imaging
                  and DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift surveys, down to a
                  stellar mass of log M*= 10.25 Msun. Galaxy
                  environments are measured in terms of
                  nearest-neighbour densities as well as fixed
                  aperture densities and kinematical and dynamical
                  parameters of neighbour galaxies within a radius of
                  1 h-1 Mpc. We disentangle the correlations between
                  galaxy stellar mass, galaxy colour and galaxy
                  environment, using not only galaxy number densities,
                  but also other environmental characteristics such as
                  velocity dispersion, mean harmonic radius and
                  crossing time.  We find that galaxy colour and the
                  fraction of blue galaxies depends very strongly on
                  stellar mass at 0.4 < z < 1, while a weak additional
                  dependence on local number densities is in place at
                  lower redshifts (0.4 < z < 0.7). This environmental
                  influence is most visible in the colours of
                  intermediate-mass galaxies (10.5 < log M* < 11),
                  whereas colours of lower- and higher-mass galaxies
                  remain largely unchanged with redshift and
                  environment. At a fixed stellar mass, the
                  colour-density relation almost disappears, while the
                  colour-stellar mass relation is present at all local
                  densities. We find a weak correlation between
                  stellar mass and environment at intermediate
                  redshifts, which contributes to the overall
                  colour-density relation. We furthermore do not find
                  a significant correlation between galaxy colour and
                  virial mass, i.e. parent dark matter halo
                  mass. Galaxy stellar mass thus appears to be the
                  crucial defining parameter for intrinsic galaxy

                  efficiency and scaling parameters yield an excellent
                  fit not only to the observed abundance of
                  low-redshift galaxies over five orders of magnitude
                  in stellar mass and 9 mag in luminosity, but also to
                  the observed abundance of Milky Way satellites. This
                  suggests that reionization effects may not be needed
                  to solve the 'missing-satellite' problem, except,
                  perhaps, for the faintest objects. The same model
                  matches the observed large-scale clustering of
                  galaxies as a function of stellar mass and
                  colour. The fit remains excellent down to ˜30 kpc
                  for massive galaxies. For M* < 6 × 1010 Msun,
                  however, the model overpredicts clustering at scales
                  below ˜1 Mpc, suggesting that the assumed
                  fluctuation amplitude, σ8= 0.9, is too high. The
                  observed difference in clustering between active and
                  passive galaxies is matched quite well for all
                  masses. Galaxy distributions within rich clusters
                  agree between the simulations and match those
                  observed, but only if galaxies without dark matter
                  subhaloes (so-called orphans) are included. Even at
                  MS-II resolution, schemes which assign galaxies only
                  to resolved dark matter subhaloes cannot match
                  observed clusters. Our model predicts a larger
                  passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is
                  observed, as well as an overabundance of ˜1010 Msun
                  galaxies beyond z˜ 0.6. (The abundance of ˜1011 Msun
                  galaxies is matched out to z˜ 3.) These
                  discrepancies appear to reflect deficiencies in the
                  way star formation rates are modelled.},

  abstract =     {The integrated ultraviolet flux arising from QSOs
                  and/or hot, massive stars in metal-producing young
                  galaxies is likely responsible for maintaining the
                  intergalactic diffuse gas and the Lyα forest clouds
                  in a highly ionized state. The spectrum and
                  intensity of such UV background have generally been
                  obtained by modeling the reprocessing due to
                  intervening material as a pure photoelectric
                  absorption process.  However, owing to the emission
                  from radiative recombinations within the absorbing
                  clouds, a photoionized clumpy medium could
                  contribute substantially to the metagalactic
                  flux. In other words, QSO absorption- line systems
                  are sources, not just sinks of ionizing photons. We
                  present a detailed calculation of the propagation of
                  AGN-like ionizing radiation through the
                  intergalactic space. We model the ionization state
                  of absorbing clouds, and show that the universe will
                  be more opaque above 4 Ry than previously
                  estimated. Singly ionized helium in Lyα forest
                  clouds and Lyman-limit systems is found to be very
                  efficient in reprocessing soft X-ray,
                  helium-ionizing photons into ultraviolet,
                  hydrogen-ionizing ones. We demonstrate that a
                  significant fraction of the absorbed primary photons
                  (emitted, e.g., by quasar sources) will be
                  reradiated by the photoionized gas through Lyα line
                  emission, two-photon continuum, and recombination
                  continuum radiation.  In the light of new data and
                  recent studies, we also reassess the contribution of
                  the QSOs observed in optical surveys to the UV
                  extragalactic background, and find that the
                  stochastic reprocessing of quasar Lyman continuum
                  radiation by hydrogen and helium along the line of
                  sight will significantly affect the amplitude,
                  spectral shape, and fluctuation properties of the
                  metagalactic flux. In a scenario in which QSOs are
                  the primary source of ionizing photons in the
                  universe, the integrated H I Lyα emission at z = 0
                  from photoionized Lyα clouds and Lyman limit systems
                  is found to be at a level of less than 5 percent of current
                  observational limits on the far-UV extragalactic
                  radiation flux.  We show that J_912_ increases from
                  10^-23^ ergs cm^-2^ s^-1^ Hz^- 1^ sr^-1^ at the
                  present epoch to ~5 x 10^-22^ ergs cm^-2^ s^-1^
                  Hz^-1^ sr^-1^ at z = 2.5. The attenuated direct
                  quasar emission plus recombination radiation from
                  intergalactic gas appear to provide enough
                  hydrogen-ionizing photons to satisfy the proximity
                  effect at large redshift. The He II/H I ratio in the
                  diffuse intergalactic medium and the Lyα clouds
                  increases from ~25 at z = 0 to ~45 at z = 2.5, to
                  decrease again below 30 for z >~ 4.5. The spectrum
                  of the ionizing background at high redshift is shown
                  to have a hump at energies below 40.8 eV due to
                  redshift-smeared He Il Lyα line and two-photon
                  continuum emission. We propose that observations of
                  low-ionization species such as O II in metal-line
                  absorption systems may be able to test the presence
                  of such a prominent feature in the UV background
                  spectrum. We also note that, if the metagalactic
                  flux is dominated by QSOs, the suggested steep
                  decline of their ionizing emissivity beyond z ~ 4
                  should produce an increase in the observed rate of
                  incidence of Lyα forest clouds at these redshifts
                  relative to an extrapolation from the intermediate-z
                  regime, as observed by Williger et al. (1994).},

  abstract =     {Using a series of high-resolution N-body simulations
                  of the concordance cosmology we investigate how the
                  formation histories, shapes and angular momenta of
                  dark matter haloes depend on environment. We first
                  present a classification scheme that allows us to
                  distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments,
                  sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of
                  matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple
                  measure of the local density) is based on a
                  local-stability criterion for the orbits of test
                  particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich
                  approximation. Applying this scheme to our
                  simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly
                  histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on
                  environment for haloes of mass M < M* (haloes of a
                  given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger
                  in voids) and are independent of it for larger
                  masses (M* here indicates the typical mass scale
                  which is entering the non-linear regime of
                  perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in
                  clusters are generally less spherical and more
                  prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes
                  in clusters have a higher median spin than in
                  filaments and present a more prominent fraction of
                  rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major
                  mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all
                  these relations, we provide accurate functional fits
                  as a function of halo mass and environment.  We also
                  look for correlations between halo-spin directions
                  and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect
                  is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie
                  within the plane of symmetry of the mass
                  distribution.  Finally, we measure the spatial
                  autocorrelation of spin directions and the
                  cross-correlation between the directions of
                  intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of
                  neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is
                  always very small, we find that spin-orbit
                  correlations are rather strong especially for
                  low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in
                  filaments.},

                  scale collapsing at redshift z, is performed, there
                  is no further significant redshift dependence in the

                  halo shape and formation time at all investigated
                  redshifts for haloes with masses M M ∗ and (iii)
                  there is a significant alignment of both spin and
                  shape of haloes with filaments and sheets. In
                  detail, at all redshifts up to z = 1: (a) haloes
                  with masses below ∼ M ∗ tend to be more oblate when
                  located in clusters than in the other environments;
                  this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about
                  M ∗ , haloes in clusters are typically more prolate
                  than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and
                  voids. (b) The haloes with M M ∗ in filaments spin
                  more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters;
                  haloes in voids have the lowest median spin
                  parameters. (c) Haloes with M M ∗ tend to be younger
                  in voids and older in clusters.  (d) In sheets, halo
                  spin vectors tend to lie preferentially within the
                  sheet plane independent of halo mass; in filaments,
                  instead, haloes with M M ∗ tend to spin parallel to
                  the filament and higher mass haloes perpendicular to
                  it. For halo masses M M ∗ , the major axis of haloes
                  in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the
                  host filament or the sheet plane, respectively.
                  Such halo–LSS alignments may be of importance in
                  weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear.  A question
                  that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 < z < 1
                  redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass
                  scale for gravitational collapse, M ∗ , sets roughly
                  the threshold below which the LSS environment either
                  begins to affect, or reverses, fundamental
                  properties of dark matter haloes.},

                  anti-correlation between the formation epoch of
                  galactic dark-matter haloes and their environment
                  density. This correlation has been revealed from
                  cosmological N-body simulations and is in conflict
                  with the extended Press-Schechter model of halo
                  clustering. Using similar simulations, we first
                  quantify the straightforward association of an early
                  formation epoch with a reduced mass-growth rate at
                  late times. We then find that a primary driver of
                  suppressed growth, by accretion and mergers, is
                  tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive
                  halo. The tidal effects range from a slowdown of the
                  assembly of haloes due to the shear along the
                  large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to
                  actual mass loss in haloes that pass through the

                  problem, we show that haloes are prone to tidal mass
                  loss within 1.5 virial radii of a larger halo. Our
                  results suggest that the dependence of the formation
                  epoch on environment density is a secondary effect
                  induced by the enhanced density of haloes in
                  filaments near massive haloes where the tides are
                  strong. Our measures of assembly rate are
                  particularly correlated with the tidal field at high
                  redshifts z ~ 1.},

  abstract =     {We use a 380-h-1 pc resolution hydrodynamic adaptive
                  mesh refinement (AMR) simulation of a cosmic
                  filament to investigate the orientations of a sample
                  of ~100 well-resolved galactic discs spanning two
                  orders of magnitude in both stellar and halo
                  mass. We find: (i) at z = 0, there is an almost
                  perfect alignment at a median angle of 18°, in the
                  inner dark matter halo regions where the discs
                  reside, between the spin vector of the gaseous and
                  stellar galactic discs and that of their inner host
                  haloes. The alignment between galaxy spin and spin
                  of the entire host halo is however significantly
                  weaker, ranging from a median of ~ 46° at z = 1 to
                  50° at z = 0. (ii) The most massive galaxy discs
                  have spins preferentially aligned so as to point
                  along their host filaments. (iii) The spin of discs
                  in lower mass haloes shows, at redshifts above z 0.5
                  and in regions of low environmental density, a clear
                  signature of alignment with the intermediate
                  principal axis of the large-scale tidal field. This
                  behaviour is consistent with predictions of linear
                  tidal torque theory. This alignment decreases with
                  increasing environmental density, and vanishes in
                  the highest density regions. Non-linear effects in
                  the high-density environments are plausibly
                  responsible for establishing this density-alignment
                  correlation. We expect that our numerical results
                  provide important insights for both understanding
                  intrinsic alignment in weak lensing from the
                  astrophysical perspective and formation and

  abstract =     {We report evidence for extended gamma-ray emission
                  from the Virgo, Fornax and Coma clusters based on a
                  maximum-likelihood analysis of the 3-year Fermi-LAT
                  data. For all three clusters, excess emission is
                  observed within three degrees of the center, peaking
                  at the GeV scale. This emission cannot be accounted
                  for by known Fermi sources or by the galactic and
                  extragalactic backgrounds. If interpreted as
                  annihilation emission from supersymmetric dark
                  matter (DM) particles, the data prefer models with a
                  particle mass in the range 20-60 GeV annihilating
                  into the b-bbar channel, or 2-10 GeV and >1 TeV
                  annihilating into mu-mu final states. Our results
                  are consistent with those obtained by Hooper and
                  Linden from a recent analysis of Fermi-LAT data in
                  the region of the Galactic Centre. An extended DM
                  annihilation profile dominated by emission from
                  substructures is preferred over a simple point
                  source model. The significance of DM detection is
                  4.4 sigma in Virgo and lower in the other two
                  clusters. We also consider the possibility that the
                  excess emission arises from cosmic ray (CR) induced
                  gamma-rays, and infer a CR level within a factor of
                  three of that expected from analytical
                  models. However, the significance of a CR component
                  is lower than the significance of a DM component,
                  and there is no need for such a CR component in the
                  presence of a DM component in the preferred DM mass
                  range. We also set flux and cross-section upper
                  limits for DM annihilation into the b-bbar and mu-mu
                  channels in all three clusters.},

  abstract =     {We investigate the orbital evolution of satellite
                  galaxies using numerical simulations. It has long
                  been believed that orbits suffer circularization due
                  to dynamical friction from the galactic halo during
                  orbital decay.  This circularization was confirmed
                  by numerous simulations in which dynamical friction
                  was added as an external force. However, some of the
                  recent N-body simulations have demonstrated that
                  circularization is much slower than expected from
                  approximate calculations. We find that the dominant
                  reason for this discrepancy is the assumption that
                  the Coulomb logarithm logΛ is constant, which has
                  been used in practically all recent
                  calculations. Since the size of the satellite is
                  relatively large, an accurate determination of the
                  outer cutoff radius is crucial to obtaining a good
                  estimate for the dynamical friction. An excellent
                  agreement between N-body simulations and approximate
                  calculations is observed when the outer cutoff
                  radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite
                  to the center of the galaxy. When the satellite is
                  at the perigalacticon, the distance to the center is
                  smaller, and therefore logΛ becomes smaller. As a
                  result, the dynamical friction becomes less
                  effective. We apply our result to the Large
                  Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the expected
                  lifetime of the LMC is twice as long as that which
                  would be predicted with previous calculations.
                  Previous studies predict that the LMC will merge
                  into the Milky Way after 7 Gyr, while we find that
                  the merging will take place 14 Gyr from now. Our
                  result suggests that generally, satellites formed
                  around a galaxy have longer lifetimes than previous
                  estimates.},

  abstract =     {Weak gravitational lensing is now established as a
                  powerful method to measure mass fluctuations in the
                  universe. It relies on the measurement of small
                  coherent distortions of the images of background
                  galaxies.  Even low-level correlations in the
                  intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce a
                  significant spurious lensing signal. These
                  correlations are also interesting in their own
                  right, since their detection would constrain models
                  of galaxy formation. Using ɛi [(α2-β2)/α2-β2)] {cos
                  2α,sin 2α}, 3×104-105 haloes found in N-body
                  simulations, we compute the correlation functions of
                  the intrinsic ellipticity of spiral galaxies
                  assuming that the disc is perpendicular to the
                  angular momentum of the dark matter halo. We also
                  consider a simple model for elliptical galaxies, in
                  which the shape of the dark matter halo is assumed
                  to be the same as that of the light. For deep
                  lensing surveys with median redshifts ~1, we find
                  that intrinsic correlations of ~10-4 on angular
                  scales ɛir, q~0.1-10arcmin are generally below the
                  expected lensing signal, and contribute only a small
                  fraction of the excess signals reported on these
                  scales. On larger scales we find limits to the
                  intrinsic correlation function at a level ~10-5,
                  which gives a (model-dependent) range of separations
                  for which the intrinsic signal is about an order of
                  magnitude below the ellipticity correlation function
                  expected from weak lensing. Intrinsic correlations
                  are thus negligible on these scales for dedicated
                  weak lensing surveys. For wider but shallower
                  surveys such as SuperCOSMOS, APM and SDSS, we cannot
                  exclude the possibility that intrinsic correlations
                  could dominate the lensing signal. We discuss how
                  such surveys could be used to calibrate the
                  importance of this effect, as well as study
                  spin-spin correlations of spiral galaxies.},

                  tidal torques acting on matter in the neighbourhood
                  of local density maxima when the density
                  perturbations are small. They find that high peaks
                  experience higher torques than low peaks. The higher
                  torques acting on the high peaks are counteracted by
                  the shorter collapse time during which the torques
                  can act. Which effect is dominant depends on the
                  perturbation power spectrum: for power spectra
                  characteristic of both cold dark matter and hot dark
                  matter, the effects nearly cancel, and the total
                  angular momentum acquired by a collapsing object is

                  any real galaxy, in terms of common observational
                  parameters. This allows a rough estimate of λ, which
                  we apply to a large volume-limited sample of
                  galaxies taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
                  data base. The large numbers involved (11597) allow
                  the derivation of reliable λ distributions, as
                  signal adds up significantly in spite of the errors
                  in the inferences for particular galaxies.  We find
                  that if the observed distribution of λ is modelled
                  with a lognormal function, as often done for this
                  distribution in dark matter haloes that appear in
                  cosmological simulations, we obtain parameters λ0 =
                  0.04 +/- 0.005 and σλ = 0.51 +/- 0.05, interestingly
                  consistent with values derived from simulations. For
                  spirals, we find a good correlation between
                  empirical values of λ and visually assigned Hubble
                  types, highlighting the potential of this physical

                  gravitational lensing measurements by the intrinsic
                  alignment of close pairs of galaxies.  We do this by
                  investigating both the aperture mass B mode
                  statistic, and the shear correlations of close and
                  distant pairs of galaxies.  These can be used to
                  quantify non-lensing effects in weak lensing
                  surveys. We reanalyse the COMBO-17 survey, and study
                  published results from the Red-sequence Cluster
                  Survey and the VIRMOS-DESCART survey, concluding
                  that the intrinsic alignment effect is at the lower
                  end of the range of theoretical predictions. We also
                  revisit this theoretical issue, and show that
                  misalignment of baryon and halo angular momenta may
                  be an important effect which can reduce the
                  intrinsic ellipticity correlations estimated from
                  numerical simulations to the level that we and the
                  SuperCOSMOS survey observe. We re-examine the
                  cosmological parameter estimation from the COMBO-17
                  survey, using the shear correlation function, and
                  now marginalizing over the Hubble constant. Assuming
                  no evolution in galaxy clustering, and marginalizing
                  over the intrinsic alignment signal, we find the
                  mass clustering amplitude is reduced by 0.03 to
                  σ8(Ωm/0.27)0.6= 0.71 +/- 0.11, where Ωm is the
                  matter density parameter. We consider the
                  forthcoming SuperNova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) wide
                  weak lensing survey, and the Canada-France-Hawaii
                  Telescope Legacy wide synoptic survey; we expect
                  them to be contaminated on scales >1 arcmin by
                  intrinsic alignments at the level of ~1 and ~2 per
                  cent, respectively. Division of the SNAP survey for
                  lensing tomography significantly increases the
                  contamination in the lowest redshift bin to ~7 per
                  cent and possibly higher. Removal of the intrinsic
                  alignment effect by the downweighting of nearby
                  galaxy pairs will therefore be vital for SNAP.},

  abstract =     {Intrinsic alignments of galaxies can mimic to an
                  extent the effects of shear caused by weak
                  gravitational lensing. Previous studies have shown
                  that for shallow surveys with median redshifts zm
                  0.1, the intrinsic alignment dominates the lensing
                  signal. For deep surveys with zm~ 1, intrinsic
                  alignments are believed to be a significant
                  contaminant of the lensing signal, preventing
                  high-precision measurements of the matter power
                  spectrum. In this paper we show how distance
                  information, either spectroscopic or photometric
                  redshifts, can be used to downweight nearby pairs in
                  an optimized way, to reduce the errors in the shear
                  signal arising from intrinsic alignments. Provided a
                  conservatively large intrinsic alignment is assumed,
                  the optimized weights will essentially remove all
                  traces of contamination. For the Sloan spectroscopic
                  galaxy sample, residual shot noise continues to
                  render it unsuitable for weak lensing
                  studies. However, a dramatic improvement for the
                  slightly deeper Sloan photometric survey is found,
                  whereby the intrinsic contribution, at angular
                  scales greater than 1 arcmin, is reduced from about
                  80 times the lensing signal to a 10 per cent
                  effect. For deeper surveys such as the COMBO-17
                  survey with zm~ 0.6, the optimization reduces the
                  error from a largely systematic~220 per cent error
                  at small angular scales to a much smaller and
                  largely statistical error of only 17 per cent of the
                  expected lensing signal.  We therefore propose that
                  future weak lensing surveys be accompanied by the
                  acquisition of photometric redshifts, in order to
                  remove fully the unknown intrinsic alignment errors
                  from weak lensing detections.},

  abstract =     {Dark matter annihilating in our galaxy's halo and
                  elsewhere in the universe is expected to generate a
                  diffuse flux of gamma rays, potentially observable
                  with next generation satellite-based experiments,
                  such as GLAST. In this paper, we study the
                  signatures of dark matter in the angular
                  distribution of this radiation, in particular the
                  deterministic ones. We discuss the effect,
                  pertaining to the extragalactic contribution, of the
                  motion of the solar system with respect to the
                  cosmological rest frame, and anisotropies due to the
                  structure of our local universe.  For the gamma ray
                  flux from dark matter in our own galactic halo, we
                  discuss the effects of the offset position of the
                  solar system, the Compton Getting effect, the
                  asphericity of the Milky Way halo, and the
                  signatures of nearby substructure. We explore the
                  prospects for the detection of these features by the
                  GLAST satellite and find that, if ~10 percent or more of
                  the diffuse gamma ray background observed by EGRET
                  is the result of dark matter annihilations, then
                  GLAST should be sensitive to anisotropies at the
                  sub-per cent level. Such precision would be
                  sufficient to detect many, if not all, of the
                  signatures discussed in this paper.},

  abstract =     {We present analytic calculations of angular momentum
                  transport and gas inflow in galaxies, from scales of
                  ˜ kpc to deep inside the potential of a central
                  massive black hole (BH). We compare these analytic
                  calculations to numerical simulations and use them
                  to develop a sub-grid model of BH growth that can be
                  incorporated into semi-analytic calculations or
                  cosmological simulations. Motivated by both analytic
                  calculations and simulations of gas inflow in
                  galactic nuclei, we argue that the strongest torque
                  on gas arises when non-axisymmetric perturbations to
                  the stellar gravitational potential produce orbit
                  crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both
                  at large radii ˜0.01-1 kpc, where bar-like stellar
                  modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and
                  at smaller radii ≲10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric
                  stellar disc dominates. The traditional
                  orbit-crossing criterion is not always adequate to
                  predict the locations of, and inflow due to, shocks
                  in gas+stellar discs with finite sound speeds. We
                  derive a modified criterion that predicts the
                  presence of shocks in stellar-dominated systems even
                  absent formal orbit crossing. We then derive
                  analytic expressions for the loss of angular
                  momentum and the resulting gas inflow rates in the
                  presence of such shocks. We test our analytic
                  predictions using hydrodynamic simulations at a
                  range of galactic scales, and show that they
                  successfully predict the mass inflow rates and
                  quasi-steady gas surface densities with a small
                  scatter ≃0.3 dex. We use our analytic results to
                  construct a new estimate of the BH accretion rate
                  given galaxy properties at larger radii, for use in
                  galaxy and cosmological simulations and
                  semi-analytic models.  While highly simplified, this
                  accretion rate predictor captures the key scalings
                  in the numerical simulations. By contrast, alternate
                  estimates such as the local viscous accretion rate
                  or the spherical Bondi rate fail systematically to
                  reproduce the simulations and have significantly
                  larger scatter.},

                  Bright Galaxies, the spatial orientation of 220
                  bright isolated field disk galaxies (41 S0, 174 S,
                  and 5 Irr) in the Local Supercluster (LSC) has been
                  analyzed. The sample of field galaxies is
                  constructed by selecting disk galaxies with cz <=
                  3000 km s-1 and excluding all galaxies of the groups
                  or clusters of at least three members. Emphasis is
                  placed on exploring morphological dependence of
                  orientation of field galaxies.  Main results are as
                  follows: (1) The distribution of orientation of spin
                  vectors of bright field disk galaxies of LSC is
                  found to be significantly anisotropic and different
                  from that of the Virgo member. (2) Orientation of
                  bright field disk galaxies is morphological
                  dependent, and therefore the process of formation of
                  galaxies is as well. The distribution of spin
                  vectors of the lenticulars, of which spatial
                  distribution is most concentrated toward the LSC
                  plane, is significantly anisotropic, and they tend
                  to lay their spin vectors parallel to the LSC plane,
                  while merely a weak tendency of laying spin vectors
                  parallel to the LSC plane is found for the spirals
                  superposing on background of the expected isotropic
                  distribution. This hints that the process of
                  formation of galaxies might also be morphology
                  dependent; bright lenticulars and spirals might be
                  formed by different processes relevant to the
                  formation of LSC. (3) The projection on the LSC
                  plane of the orientation of spin vectors of field
                  galaxies does not show any tendency of pointing
                  toward the direction of the Virgo center. (4) Field
                  galaxies may serve as a better probe to detect the
                  information in early universe.},

                  galaxies in the Local Supercluster (LSC) is reviewed
                  and a summary of recent results is given. Following
                  a brief introduction of the LSC, we describe the
                  results of early studies based on two-dimensional
                  analysis, which were mostly not conclusive. We
                  describe next the three-dimensional analysis, which
                  is used widely today. Difficulties and systematic
                  effects are explained and the importance of
                  selection effects is described. Then, results based
                  on the new method and modern databases are given,
                  which are summarized as follows. When the LSC is
                  seen as a whole, galaxy planes tend to align
                  perpendicular to the LSC plane with lenticulars
                  showing the most pronounced tendency. Projections
                  onto the LSC plane of the spin vectors of Virgo
                  cluster member galaxies, and to some extent, those
                  of the total LSC galaxies, tend to point to the
                  Virgo cluster center. This tendency is more
                  pronounced for lenticulars than for spirals. It is
                  suggested that ‘field’ galaxies, i.e., those which
                  do not belong to groups with more than three
                  members, may be better objects than other galaxies
                  to probe the information at the early epoch of the
                  LSC formation through the analysis of galaxy
                  orientations. Field lenticulars show a pronounced
                  anisotropic distribution of spin vectors in the
                  sense that they lay their spin vectors parallel to
                  the LSC plane while field spirals show an isotropic
                  spin-vector distribution.},

  abstract =     {We study the dependence of satellite galaxy
                  properties on the distance to the host galaxy and
                  the orbital motion (prograde and retrograde orbits)
                  using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. From
                  SDSS Data Release 7, we find 3515 isolated satellite
                  systems of galaxies at z < 0.03 that contain 8904
                  satellite galaxies. Using this sample, we construct
                  a catalog of 635 satellites associated with 215 host
                  galaxies whose spin directions are determined by our
                  inspection of the SDSS color images and/or by
                  spectroscopic observations in the literature. We
                  divide satellite galaxies into prograde and
                  retrograde orbit subsamples depending on their
                  orbital motion with respect to the spin direction of
                  the host. We find that the number of galaxies in
                  prograde orbit is nearly equal to that of retrograde
                  orbit galaxies: the fraction of satellites in
                  prograde orbit is 50 ± 2 percent. The velocity
                  distribution of satellites with respect to their
                  hosts is found to be almost symmetric: the median
                  bulk rotation of satellites is -1 ± 8 km s-1. It is
                  found that the radial distribution of early-type
                  satellites in prograde orbit is strongly
                  concentrated toward the host while that of
                  retrograde ones shows much less concentration.  We
                  also find the orbital speed of late-type satellites
                  in prograde orbit increases as the projected
                  distance to the host (R) decreases while the speed
                  decreases for those in retrograde orbit. At R less
                  than 0.1 times the host virial radius (R < 0.1r
                  vir,host), the orbital speed decreases in both
                  prograde and retrograde orbit cases. Prograde
                  satellites are on average fainter than retrograde
                  satellites for both early and late morphological
                  types. The u - r color becomes redder as R decreases
                  for both prograde and retrograde orbit late-type
                  satellites. The differences between prograde and
                  retrograde orbit satellite galaxies may be
                  attributed to their different origin or the
                  different strength of physical processes that they
                  have experienced through hydrodynamic interactions
                  with their host galaxies.},

                  AU are the first structures formed in the universe,
                  if the dark matter of the universe is made of
                  neutralinos. Here, we report the results of
                  ultra-high-resolution simulations of the formation
                  and evolution of these microhalos. We found that
                  microhalos have the central density cusps of the
                  form ρ vprop r -1.5, much steeper than the cusps of
                  larger dark halos.  The central regions of these
                  microhalos survive the encounters with stars except
                  in the very inner region of the galaxy down to the
                  radius of a few hundreds parsecs from the galactic
                  center. The annihilation signals from the nearest
                  microhalos are observed as gamma-ray point sources
                  (radius less than 1'), with unusually large proper
                  motions of ~0.2 deg yr-1. Their surface brightnesses
                  are ~10 percent of that of the galactic center. Their
                  signal-to-noise ratios might be better if they are
                  far from the galactic plane. Luminosities of
                  subhalos are determined only by their mass, and they
                  are more than one order of magnitude more luminous
                  than the estimation by Springel et al.: a boost
                  factor can be larger than 1000. Perturbations to the
                  millisecond pulsars by gravitational attractions of
                  nearby Earth-mass microhalos can be detected by the
                  observations of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.},

  abstract =     {We use a large set of state-of-the-art cosmological
                  N-body simulations [5123 particles] to study the
                  intrinsic ellipticity correlation functions of
                  haloes. With the simulations of different
                  resolutions, we find that the ellipticity
                  correlations converge once the haloes have more than
                  160 members. For haloes with fewer members, the
                  correlations are underestimated, and the
                  underestimation amounts to a factor of 2 when the
                  haloes have only 20 particles. After correcting for
                  the resolution effects, we show that the ellipticity
                  correlations of haloes in the bigger box L= 300 h-1
                  Mpc) agree very well with those obtained in the
                  smaller box (L= 100 h-1 Mpc). Combining these
                  results from the different simulation boxes, we
                  present accurate fitting formulae for the
                  ellipticity correlation function c11(r) and for the
                  projected correlation functions Σ11(rp) and Σ22(rp)
                  over three orders of magnitude in halo mass. The
                  latter two functions are useful for predicting the
                  contribution of the intrinsic correlations to deep
                  lensing surveys. With reasonable assumptions for the
                  redshift distribution of galaxies and for the mass
                  of galaxies, we find that the intrinsic ellipticity
                  correlation can contribute significantly not only to
                  shallow surveys but also to deep surveys. Our
                  results indicate that previous similar studies
                  significantly underestimated this contribution for
                  their limited simulation resolutions.},

                  astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe
                  and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is
                  dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark
                  matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered,
                  weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is
                  now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to
                  detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising
                  techniques involve direct detection in
                  low-background laboratory detectors and indirect
                  detection through observation of energetic neutrinos
                  from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in
                  the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP
                  candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly
                  the most theoretically developed is the neutralino,
                  the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric
                  theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric
                  extension of the Standard Model and discuss
                  prospects for detection of neutralino dark
                  matter. We review in detail how to calculate the
                  cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the
                  event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection
                  schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory
                  constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and
                  clarify the uncertainties from particle physics,
                  nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each
                  step in the calculation. We briefly review other

                  correlations of the shapes of massive dark matter
                  halos derived from Hubble volume simulations of a
                  ΛCDM universe. We measure both position and velocity
                  shapes within spheres that encompass a mean density
                  200 times the critical value and calibrate small-N
                  systematic errors using Poisson realizations of
                  isothermal spheres and higher resolution
                  simulations. For halos more massive than 3×1014 h-1
                  Msolar, the shape distribution function peaks at
                  (minor/major, intermediate/major) axial ratios of
                  (0.64, 0.76) in position and is rounder in velocity,
                  peaking at (0.72, 0.82).  Halo shapes are rounder at
                  lower mass and/or redshift; the mean minor-axis
                  ratio in position follows
                  <c/a>(M,z)=c15,0[1-αln(M/1015 h-1 Msolar)](1+z)-ɛ,
                  with c15,0=0.631+/-0.001, α=0.023+/-0.002, and
                  ɛ=0.086+/-0.004. Position and velocity principal
                  axes are well aligned in direction, with median
                  alignment angle 22°, and the axial ratios in these
                  spaces are correlated in magnitude. We investigate
                  mark correlations of halo pair orientations using
                  two measures: a simple scalar product shows >=1 percent
                  alignment extending to 30 h-1 Mpc, while a
                  filamentary statistic exhibits nonrandom alignment
                  extending to scales ~200 h-1 Mpc, 10 times the
                  sample two-point correlation length and well into
                  the regime of negative two-point correlation. Shapes
                  of cluster halos are little affected by the
                  large-scale environment; the distribution of

  abstract =     {Cosmological simulations indicate that cold dark
                  matter (CDM) halos should be triaxial. Validating
                  this theoretical prediction is, however, less than
                  straightforward because the assembly of galaxies is
                  expected to modify halo shapes and to render them
                  more axisymmetric. We use a suite of N-body
                  simulations to quantitatively investigate the effect
                  of the growth of a central disk galaxy on the shape
                  of triaxial dark matter halos. In most
                  circumstances, the halo responds to the presence of
                  the disk by becoming more spherical. The net effect
                  depends weakly on the timescale of the disk assembly
                  but noticeably on the orientation of the disk
                  relative to the halo principal axes, and it is
                  maximal when the disk symmetry axis is aligned with
                  the major axis of the halo. The effect depends most
                  sensitively on the overall gravitational importance
                  of the disk. Our results indicate that exponential
                  disks whose contribution peaks at less than ~50 percent of
                  their circular velocity are unable to noticeably
                  modify the shape of the gravitational potential of
                  their surrounding halos. Many dwarf and low surface
                  brightness galaxies are expected to be in this
                  regime, and therefore their detailed kinematics
                  could be used to probe halo triaxiality, one of the
                  basic predictions of the CDM paradigm. We argue that
                  the complex disk kinematics of the dwarf galaxy NGC
                  2976 might be the reflection of a triaxial
                  halo. Such signatures of halo triaxiality should be
                  common in galaxies where the luminous component is
                  subdominant.},

                  nearest neighbors are avoided. All operations on a
                  tree including tree modifications are O(N), where N
                  is a number of cells, and are performed in
                  parallel. An efficient implementation of the tree is
                  described that requires 2N words of memory. A
                  filtering algorithm for removing high-frequency
                  noise during mesh refinement is described.  A FTT
                  can be used in various numerical applications. In
                  this paper, it is applied to the integration of the
                  Euler equations of fluid dynamics. An adaptive-mesh

                  the tree.  Time stepping and mesh refinement are
                  interleaved to avoid extensive buffer layers of fine

                  to explore the evolution of dark matter and dark
                  energy in the universe. However, a possible
                  systematic contaminant of the lensing signal is
                  intrinsic galaxy alignment, with a correlation
                  length of a few Mpc. Hirata & Seljak (2004,
                  Phys. Rev. D, 70, 063526) have recently demonstrated
                  that for some models of intrinsic distortions, there
                  may also be a cross-correlation between the
                  intrinsic and lensing signals, which may dominate
                  the intrinsic signal, and suppress the lensing power
                  spectrum by several tens of percent. Unlike the pure
                  intrinsic signal, this new term cannot be accounted
                  for by neglecting or down-weighting pairs of
                  galaxies which are physically close. Extending the
                  correlation function tomography method of King &
                  Schneider (2003, A&A, 398, 23) we illustrate how the
                  impact of both intrinsic and cross-correlations can
                  be significantly reduced, in the context of surveys
                  with photometric redshift information. For a
                  ground-based cosmic shear survey of ~100 sq. degrees
                  with photometric redshifts, even in the presence of
                  systematic contaminants at the level considered
                  here, cosmological models degenerate in the Ω_m-σ8
                  plane can be distinguished well in excess of the 3-σ

                  known, with a central mass-to-light ratio
                  M/L~70. Somewhat anomalously, it appears to contain
                  morphological substructure in the form of a second
                  peak in the stellar number density.  It is often
                  argued that this substructure must be transient,
                  because it could not survive for the ~12 Gyr age of
                  the system, given the crossing time implied by UMi's
                  8.8 km s-1 internal velocity dispersion.  In this
                  Letter, however, we present evidence that the
                  substructure has a cold kinematical signature and
                  argue that UMi's clumpiness could indeed be a
                  primordial artefact. Using numerical simulations, we
                  demonstrate that substructure is incompatible with
                  the cusped dark matter halos predicted by the
                  prevailing cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm but is
                  consistent with an unbound stellar cluster sloshing
                  back and forth within the nearly harmonic potential
                  of a cored dark matter halo. Thus, CDM appears to
                  disagree with observation at the least massive, most

  abstract =     {According to the hierarchical clustering scenario,
                  galaxies are assembled by merging and accretion of
                  numerous satellites of di†erent sizes and
                  masses. This ongoing process is not 100 percent efficient
                  in destroying all of the accreted satellites, as
                  evidenced by the satellites of our Galaxy and of
                  M31. Using published data, we have compiled the
                  circular velocity (V ) distribution function (VDF)
                  of galaxy satellites in the circ Local Group. We Ðnd
                  that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400
                  h~1 kpc assuming the Hubble constant1 h \ 0.7)
                  centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average
                  VDF is roughly approx- imated as n( [ V ) B 55 ^
                  11(V /10 km s~1)~1.4B0.4 h3 Mpc~3 for V in the range
                  B10È70 km s~1.  circ circ The observed VDF is
                  comparedcirc with results of high-resolution
                  cosmological simulations. We Ðnd that the VDF in
                  models is very di†erent from the observed one : n( [
                  V ) B 1200(V /10 km s~1)~2.75 h3 circ
                  Mpc~3. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo
                  the size of ourcirc Galaxy should have about 50 dark
                  matter satellites with circular velocity greater
                  than 20 km s~1 and mass greater than 3 ] 108 M
                  within a 570 kpc radius. This number is signiÐcantly
                  higher than the approximately dozen satellites _
                  actually observed around our Galaxy. The di†erence
                  is even larger if we consider the abundance of
                  satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the
                  Local Group. The models predict D300 satellites
                  inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only D40 satellites
                  are observed in the Local Group.  The observed and
                  predicted VDFs cross at B50 km s~1, indicating that
                  the predicted abundance of satellites with V Z 50 km
                  s~1 is in reasonably good agreement with
                  observations. We conclude, therefore, that
                  unlesscirc large fraction a of the Local Group
                  satellites has been missed in observations, there is
                  a dramatic discrepancy between observations and
                  hierarchical models, regardless of the model
                  parameters.  We discuss several possible
                  explanations for this discrepancy including
                  identiÐcation of some satellites with the
                  high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and
                  the existence of dark satellites that failed to
                  accrete gas and form stars either because of the
                  expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or
                  because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing

                  model. We report these limits and use them to
                  constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via
                  Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of
                  primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and

                  0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and
                  SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio
                  of r < 0.22(95 percentCL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored
                  even when gravitational waves are included, which
                  constrains the models of inflation that can produce
                  significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or
                  power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such
                  as hybrid inflation models.  We obtain tight,
                  simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of
                  state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of
                  the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95 percent CL) and
                  -0.0179 < Ω k < 0.0081(95 percent CL). We provide a set of
                  "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark
                  energy models with spatial curvature. We test a
                  time-dependent w with a present value constrained as
                  -0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95 percent CL). Temperature and
                  dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the
                  adiabatic relation to within 8.9 and 2.1 percent for the
                  axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter,
                  respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB
                  correlations constrain a parity-violating
                  interaction, which rotates the polarization angle
                  and converts E to B. The polarization angle could
                  not be rotated more than -5fdg9 < Δα < 2fdg4 (95 percent
                  CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We
                  find the limit on the total mass of massive
                  neutrinos of ∑m ν < 0.67 eV(95 percent CL), which is free
                  from the uncertainty in the normalization of the
                  large-scale structure data. The number of
                  relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in
                  units of the effective number of neutrino species,
                  is constrained as N eff = 4.4 ± 1.5 (68 percent),
                  consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally,
                  quantitative limits on physically-motivated
                  primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f
                  local NL < 111 (95 percent CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253
                  (95 percent CL) for the local and equilateral models,
                  respectively.  WMAP is the result of a partnership

  abstract =     {The environment where galaxies are found heavily
                  influences their evolution. Close groupings, like
                  the ones in the cores of galaxy clusters or compact
                  groups, evolve in ways far more dramatic than their
                  isolated counterparts. We have conducted a
                  multi-wavelength study of Hickson Compact Group 7
                  (HCG 7), consisting of four giant galaxies: three
                  spirals and one lenticular. We use Hubble Space
                  Telescope (HST) imaging to identify and characterize
                  the young and old star cluster populations. We find
                  young massive clusters (YMCs) mostly in the three
                  spirals, while the lenticular features a large,
                  unimodal population of globular clusters (GCs) but
                  no detectable clusters with ages less than a few
                  Gyr. The spatial and approximate age distributions
                  of the ~300 YMCs and ~150 GCs thus hint at a regular
                  star formation history in the group over a Hubble
                  time. While at first glance the HST data show the
                  galaxies as undisturbed, our deep ground-based,
                  wide-field imaging that extends the HST coverage
                  reveals faint signatures of stellar material in the
                  intragroup medium (IGM). We do not, however, detect
                  the IGM in H I or Chandra X-ray observations,
                  signatures that would be expected to arise from
                  major mergers. Despite this fact, we find that the H
                  I gas content of the individual galaxies and the
                  group as a whole are a third of the expected
                  abundance. The appearance of quiescence is
                  challenged by spectroscopy that reveals an intense
                  ionization continuum in one galaxy nucleus, and
                  post-burst characteristics in another. Our
                  spectroscopic survey of dwarf galaxy members yields
                  a single dwarf elliptical galaxy in an apparent
                  stellar tidal feature.  Based on all this
                  information, we suggest an evolutionary scenario for
                  HCG 7, whereby the galaxies convert most of their
                  available gas into stars without the influence of
                  major mergers and ultimately result in a dry
                  merger. As the conditions governing compact groups
                  are reminiscent of galaxies at intermediate
                  redshift, we propose that HCGs are appropriate for
                  studying galaxy evolution at z ~ 1-2.  Based on
                  observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space

                  Milky Way satellites in data release 5 (DR5) of the
                  Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and use this to
                  estimate the luminosity function of faint satellite
                  galaxies in our halo. We develop a satellite
                  detection algorithm based on the convolution of the
                  DR5 star catalog with a kernel of zero net flux that
                  is the difference of a narrow positive Gaussian and
                  a much wider negative Gaussian, which removes the
                  background star-count level. This permits us to
                  assess the significance of any (positive) detection
                  in terms of deviations of this map. The efficiency
                  of this algorithm is tested by computing the
                  recovery rate of a large set of mock objects added
                  to SDSS DR5 as a function of their luminosity, size
                  and distance from the Sun. Most of the recent Milky
                  Way satellite discoveries, made by SDSS, are shown
                  to lie very close to the survey’s detection
                  limits. Calculating the maximum accessible volume
                  Vmax for all faint detected objects makes it
                  possible for the first time to calculate the
                  luminosity function for the Milky Way satellite
                  galaxies, accounting consistently and
                  algorithmically for their detection biases. The
                  number density of satellite galaxies continues to
                  rise towards low luminosities, but may flatten at MV
                  ˜ -5. Within the uncertainties the luminosity
                  function can be described by a simple power law
                  dN/dMV= 10 × 100.1(MV+5), spanning luminosities from
                  MV=-2.5 all the way to the bright end. Comparing
                  these results to several galaxy formation models, we
                  find the predicted properties differ from the data.},

                  star formation event in a given volume of space is

                  been estimated from low-mass brown dwarfs to very
                  massive stars. Combining IMF estimates for different
                  populations in which the stars can be observed
                  individually unveils an extraordinary uniformity of
                  the IMF. This general insight appears to hold for
                  populations including present-day star formation in
                  small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive
                  star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to
                  ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations
                  that may be dominated by dark matter. This apparent
                  universality of the IMF is a challenge for star
                  formation theory, because elementary considerations
                  suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary

                  disc galaxies formed in spherical and triaxial cuspy
                  dark matter haloes and spherical cored dark matter
                  haloes. The simulated galaxies are 'observed' under
                  a variety of realistic conditions to determine how
                  well the underlying dark matter halo can be
                  recovered and to test the hypothesis that cuspy
                  haloes can be mistaken for cored haloes. We find
                  that the appearance of the velocity field is
                  distinctly different depending on the underlying
                  halo type. We also find that we can successfully
                  recover the parameters of the underlying dark matter
                  halo. Cuspy haloes appear cuspy in the data and
                  cored haloes appear cored. Our results suggest that
                  the cores observed using high-resolution velocity
                  fields in real dark matter dominated galaxies are
                  genuine and cannot be ascribed to systematic errors,

  abstract =     {We have made a detailed comparison of the results of
                  N-body simulations with the analytical description
                  of the merging histories of dark matter haloes
                  presented in Lacey & Cole, which is based on an
                  extension of the Press-Schechter method. We find the
                  analytical predictions for the halo mass function,
                  merger rates and formation times to be remarkably
                  accurate. The N-body simulations used 128^3^
                  particles and were of self- similar clustering, with
                  {OMEGA} = 1 and initial power spectra P (k) is
                  proportional to k^n^, with spectral indices n = - 2,
                  -1,0. The analytical model is, however, expected to
                  apply for arbitrary {OMEGA} and more general power
                  spectra. Dark matter haloes were identified in the
                  simulations using two different methods and at a
                  range of overdensities. For haloes selected at mean
                  overdensities ~100-200, the analytical mass function
                  was found to provide a good fit to the simulations
                  with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by
                  the spherical collapse model, with a typical error
                  of <~ 30 per cent over a range of 10^3^ in mass,
                  which is the full dynamical range of our N-body
                  simulation. This was insensitive to the type of
                  filtering used. Over a range of 10^2^- 10^3^ in
                  mass, there was also good agreement with the
                  analytical predictions for merger rates including
                  their dependence on the masses of the two haloes
                  involved and the time interval being considered, and
                  for formation times, including the dependence on
                  halo mass and formation epoch. The analytical
                  Press-Schechter mass function and its extension to
                  halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very
                  useful description of the growth of dark matter
                  haloes through hierarchical clustering, and should
                  provide a valuable tool in studies of the formation
                  and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.},

  abstract =     {The WMAP mission has produced sky maps from seven
                  years of observations at L2. We present the angular
                  power spectra derived from the seven-year maps and
                  discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be
                  inferred from WMAP data alone. With the seven-year
                  data, the temperature (TT) spectrum measurement has
                  a signal-to-noise ratio per multipole that exceeds
                  unity for l < 919; and in band powers of width Δl =
                  10, the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds unity up to l
                  = 1060. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum
                  is now well measured by WMAP. In the context of a
                  flat ΛCDM model, this improvement allows us to place
                  tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP
                  data alone, Ω m h 2 = 0.1334+0.0056 -0.0055, and on
                  the epoch of matter-radiation equality, z eq =
                  3196+134 -133. The temperature-polarization (TE)
                  spectrum is detected in the seven-year data with a
                  significance of 20σ, compared to 13σ with the
                  five-year data. We now detect the second dip in the
                  TE spectrum near l ~ 450 with high confidence. The
                  TB and EB spectra remain consistent with zero, thus
                  demonstrating low systematic errors and foreground
                  residuals in the data. The low-l EE spectrum, a
                  measure of the optical depth due to reionization, is
                  detected at 5.5σ significance when averaged over l =
                  2-7: l(l + 1)C EE l /(2π) = 0.074+0.034 -0.025 μK2
                  (68 percent CL). We now detect the high-l, 24 <= l <= 800,
                  EE spectrum at over 8σ. The BB spectrum, an
                  important probe of gravitational waves from
                  inflation, remains consistent with zero; when
                  averaged over l = 2-7, l(l + 1)C BB l /(2π) < 0.055
                  μK2 (95 percent CL). The upper limit on tensor modes from
                  polarization data alone is a factor of two lower
                  with the seven-year data than it was using the
                  five-year data. The data remain consistent with the
                  simple ΛCDM model: the best-fit TT spectrum has an
                  effective χ2 of 1227 for 1170 degrees of freedom,
                  with a probability to exceed of 9.6 percent. The allowable
                  volume in the six-dimensional space of ΛCDM
                  parameters has been reduced by a factor of 1.5
                  relative to the five-year volume, while the ΛCDM
                  model that allows for tensor modes and a running
                  scalar spectral index has a factor of three lower
                  volume when fit to the seven-year data. We test the
                  parameter recovery process for bias and find that
                  the scalar spectral index, ns , is biased high, but
                  only by 0.09σ, while the remaining parameters are
                  biased by <0.15σ. The improvement in the third peak
                  measurement leads to tighter lower limits from WMAP
                  on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom
                  (e.g., neutrinos) in the early universe: N
                  eff>2.7(95 percent CL). Also, using WMAP data alone, the
                  primordial helium mass fraction is found to be Y He
                  = 0.28+0.14 -0.15, and with data from
                  higher-resolution cosmic microwave background
                  experiments included, we now establish the existence
                  of pre-stellar helium at >3σ. These new WMAP
                  measurements provide important tests of big bang
                  cosmology.  WMAP is the result of a partnership
                  between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard
                  Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided

  abstract =     {We present analysis of the three-dimensional shape
                  of intracluster gas in clusters formed in
                  cosmological simulations of the ΛCDM cosmology and
                  compare it to the shape of dark matter distribution
                  and the shape of the overall isopotential
                  surfaces. We find that in simulations with radiative
                  cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback (CSF),
                  intracluster gas outside the cluster core (r >~ 0.1r
                  500) is more spherical compared to non-radiative
                  (NR) simulations, while in the core the gas in the
                  CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly
                  oblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing
                  cooling of gas, which settles into a thick oblate
                  ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy.  The shape of
                  the gas in the inner regions of clusters can
                  therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas cooling. We
                  find that gas traces the shape of the underlying
                  potential rather well outside the core, as expected
                  in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller radii,
                  however, the gas and potential shapes differ
                  significantly. In the CSF runs, the difference
                  reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally
                  supported.  Interestingly, we find that in NR
                  simulations the difference between gas and potential
                  shape at small radii is due to random gas motions,
                  which make the gas distribution more spherical than
                  the equipotential surfaces. Finally, we use mock
                  Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in
                  shapes observed in a three-dimensional distribution
                  of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of X-ray
                  isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in
                  simulated clusters against observations can
                  therefore constrain the amount of cooling in the
                  intracluster medium and the presence of random gas
                  motions in cluster cores.},

  abstract =     {An unresolved question in galaxy evolution is
                  whether the star formation histories (SFHs) of
                  low-mass systems are preferentially dominated by
                  starbursts or modes that are more quiescent and
                  continuous. Here, we quantify the prevalence of
                  global starbursts in dwarf galaxies at the present
                  epoch and infer their characteristic durations and
                  amplitudes. The analysis is based on the Hα
                  component of the 11 Mpc Hα UV Galaxy Survey
                  (11HUGS), which provides Hα and Galaxy Evolution
                  Explorer UV imaging for an approximately
                  volume-limited sample of ~ 300 star-forming galaxies
                  within 11 Mpc. We first examine the completeness
                  properties of the sample, and then directly tally
                  the number of bursting dwarfs and compute the
                  fraction of star formation that is concentrated in
                  such systems. To identify starbursting dwarfs, we
                  use an integrated Hα equivalent width (EW) threshold
                  of 100 Å, which corresponds to a stellar birthrate
                  of ~ 2.5, and also explore the use of empirical
                  starburst definitions based on σ thresholds of the
                  observed logarithmic EW distributions. Our results
                  are robust to the exact choice of the threshold, and
                  are consistent with a picture where dwarfs that are
                  currently experiencing massive global bursts are
                  just the ~ 6 percent tip of a low-mass galaxy
                  iceberg. Moreover, bursts are only responsible for
                  about a quarter of the total star formation in the
                  overall dwarf population, so the majority of stars
                  in low-mass systems are not formed in this mode
                  today. Spirals and irregulars devoid of Hα emission
                  are rare, indicating that the complete cessation of
                  star formation generally does not occur in such
                  galaxies and is not characteristic of the interburst
                  state, at least for the more luminous systems with
                  MB < -15. The starburst statistics presented here
                  directly constrain the duty cycle and the average
                  burst amplitude under the simplest assumptions where
                  all dwarf irregulars share a common SFH and undergo
                  similar burst cycles with equal
                  probability. Uncertainties in such assumptions are
                  discussed in the context of previous work.},

                  Globular clusters in Virgo are found wandering

                  reconstructed recently from the 2MASS Redshift
                  Survey (2MRS) by Erdogdu et al.  in 2006. Using a
                  total of 12,122 nearby spiral galaxies from the
                  Tully Galaxy Catalog, we calculate the orientations
                  of their spin axes relative to the 2MRS tidal
                  field. We find a clear signal of the intrinsic
                  correlations between the galaxy spins and the
                  intermediate principal axes of the tidal shears. The
                  null hypothesis of no correlation is rejected at
                  99.99 percent confidence level. We also investigate the
                  dependence of the intrinsic correlations on the
                  galaxy morphological type and the environment. It is
                  found that (1) the intrinsic correlation depends
                  weakly on the morphological type of the spiral
                  galaxies, but tends to decrease slightly as the type
                  increases; and (2) it is stronger in the
                  high-density regions than in the low-density
                  regions. The observational result is quantitatively
                  consistent with analytic prediction based on the
                  tidal torque theory. It is concluded that the galaxy
                  spin orientations may provide in principle a new
                  complimentary probe of the dark matter

                  entropy; we suggest that elliptical galaxies, as
                  stellar systems in a stage of quasi-equilibrium, may
                  have in principle a unique specific entropy. This
                  uniqueness, a priori unknown, should be reflected in
                  correlations between the fundamental parameters
                  describing the mass (light) distribution in
                  galaxies. Following recent photometrical work on
                  elliptical galaxies by Caon et al., Graham & Colless
                  and Prugniel & Simien, we use the Sérsic law to
                  describe the light profile and an analytical
                  approximation to its three-dimensional
                  deprojection. The specific entropy is then
                  calculated, supposing that the galaxy behaves as a
                  spherical, isotropic, one-component system in
                  hydrostatic equilibrium, obeying the ideal-gas
                  equations of state. We predict a relation between
                  the three parameters of the Sérsic law linked to the
                  specific entropy, defining a surface in the
                  parameter space, an `Entropic Plane', by analogy
                  with the well-known Fundamental Plane. We have
                  analysed elliptical galaxies in two rich clusters of
                  galaxies (Coma and ABCG 85) and a group of galaxies
                  (associated with NGC 4839, near Coma). We show that,
                  for a given cluster, the galaxies follow closely a
                  relation predicted by the constant specific entropy
                  hypothesis with a typical dispersion (one standard
                  deviation) of 9.5per cent around the mean value of
                  the specific entropy. Moreover, assuming that the
                  specific entropy is also the same for galaxies of
                  different clusters, we are able to derive relative
                  distances between Coma, ABGC 85, and the group of
                  NGC 4839. If the errors are due only to the
                  determination of the specific entropy (about 10per
                  cent), then the error in the relative distance
                  determination should be less than 20per cent for
                  rich clusters.  We suggest that the unique specific
                  entropy may provide a physical explanation for the
                  distance indicators based on the Sérsic profile put
                  forward by Young & Currie and recently discussed by
                  Binggeli & Jerjen.},

                  1703, a massive X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z =
                  0.28. Our analysis is based on imaging data from
                  both the space and ground in 8 bands, complemented
                  by a spectroscopic survey. Abell 1703 is rather
                  circular from the general shape of its multiply
                  imaged systems and is dominated by a giant
                  elliptical cD galaxy in its centre. This cluster
                  exhibits a remarkable bright central ring formed by
                  4 images at z_spec = 0.888 only 5-13 arcsec away
                  from the cD centre. This unique feature offers a
                  rare lensing constrain for probing the central mass
                  distribution.  The stellar contribution from the cD
                  galaxy (˜1.25 × 1012 Msun within 30 kpc) is
                  accounted for in our parametric mass modelling, and
                  the underlying smooth dark matter component
                  distribution is described using a generalized nfw
                  profile parametrized with a central logarithmic
                  slope α. The rms of our mass model in the image
                  plane is equal to 1.4 arcsec. We find that within
                  the range where observational constraints are
                  present (from 20 kpc to 210 kpc), α is equal to
                  1.09+0.05-0.11 (3σ confidence level). The
                  concentration parameter is equal to c200 3.5, and
                  the scale radius is constrained to be larger than
                  the region where observational constraints are
                  available (rs =730^+15-75 kpc).  The 2D mass is
                  equal to {M} (210 kpc) = 2.4 × 1014 Msun. However,
                  we cannot draw any conclusions on cosmological
                  models at this point since we lack results from
                  realistic numerical simulations containing baryons
                  to make a proper comparison. We advocate the need
                  for a large sample of well observed (and well
                  constrained) and simulated unimodal relaxed galaxy
                  clusters in order to make reliable comparisons and
                  to potentially provide a test of cosmological
                  models.},

  abstract =     {We study the distribution of dark matter in the
                  Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy by modelling the
                  moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution
                  of stars obtained from new velocity data of
                  Wilkinson et al. The luminosity distribution is
                  approximated by a Sérsic profile fitted to the data
                  by Odenkirchen et al. We assume that the dark matter
                  density profile is given by a formula with an inner
                  cusp and an outer exponential cut-off, as recently
                  proposed by Kazantzidis et al. as a result of
                  simulations of tidal stripping of dwarfs by the
                  potential of the Milky Way. The dark matter
                  distribution is characterized by the total dark mass
                  and the cut-off radius. The models have arbitrary
                  velocity anisotropy parameter, assumed to be
                  constant with radius.  We estimate the three
                  parameters by fitting both the line-of-sight
                  velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles, which
                  allows us to break the degeneracy between the mass
                  distribution and velocity anisotropy.  The results
                  of the fitting procedure turn out to be very
                  different depending on the stellar sample
                  considered, that is, on our choice of stars with
                  discrepant velocities to be discarded as
                  interlopers.  For our most reliable sample, the
                  model parameters remain weakly constrained, but the
                  robust result is the preference for weakly
                  tangential stellar orbits and high mass-to-light
                  ratios. The best-fitting total mass is then 7 ×
                  107Msolar, much lower than recent estimates, while
                  the mass-to-light ratio is M/LV= 300Msolar/Lsolar
                  and almost constant with radius. If the binary
                  fraction in the stellar population of Draco turns
                  out to be significant, the kurtosis of the global
                  velocity distribution will be smaller and the orbits
                  inferred will be more tangential, while the
                  resulting mass estimate will be lower.},

  abstract =     {We study the behaviour of multiple radiative-cooling
                  algorithms implemented in seven semi-analytic models
                  (SAMs) of galaxy formation, including a new model we
                  propose in this paper. We use versions of the models
                  without feedback and apply them to dark matter
                  haloes growing in a cosmological context, which have
                  final virial masses that range from 1011 to 1014
                  Msun. First, using simplified smoothly growing halo
                  models, we demonstrate that the different algorithms
                  predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that
                  differ by a factor of ˜5 for massive haloes (≥1012
                  Msun). The algorithms are in better agreement for
                  less massive haloes because they cool efficiently
                  and, therefore, their cooling rates are largely
                  limited by the halo accretion rate. However, for
                  less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less
                  cooling than corresponding 1D hydrodynamic
                  models. Secondly, we study the gas-accretion history
                  of the central galaxies of dark matter haloes using
                  merger trees. The inclusion of mergers alters the
                  cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in
                  galaxies within small haloes at early times. For
                  realistic halo models, the dispersion in the cold
                  gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for
                  high-mass haloes and 0.1 dex for low-mass haloes,
                  while the dispersion in the accretion rate is about
                  two times larger. Comparing to cosmological smoothed
                  particle hydrodynamic simulations, we find that most
                  SAMs systematically underpredict the gas-accretion
                  rates for low-mass haloes but overpredict the
                  gas-accretion rates for massive haloes.  Although
                  the models all include both 'rapid'- and 'slow'-mode
                  accretion, the transition between the two accretion
                  modes varies between models and also differs from
                  the simulations. Finally, we construct a new
                  phenomenological model that explicitly incorporates
                  cold halo gas and a gradual transition between the
                  cold and hot modes of gas accretion to illustrate
                  that such a class of models can better match the
                  results from cosmological hydrodynamic
                  simulations. The large dispersion in cooling rates
                  between different SAMs influences parameter choices
                  for other galaxy physics, including star formation
                  and feedback.  Therefore, careful parametrizations
                  of the multimode gas cooling and accretion
                  mechanisms in simulations are necessary to ensure
                  that the predictions from SAMs are reliable.},

                  recovering the 3D positions and orbital phase of
                  satellites over several orbits is more
                  challenging. This owes primarily to the
                  non-sphericity of the potential and satellite
                  interactions during group infall. Dynamical
                  friction, satellite mass-loss and the mass evolution
                  of the main halo play a more minor role in the
                  uncertainties.  We apply our technique to nine Milky
                  Way dwarfs with observed proper motions. We show
                  that their mean apocentre is lower than the mean of
                  the most massive subhaloes in our cosmological
                  simulation, but consistent with the most massive
                  subhaloes that form before z = 10.  This lends
                  further support to the idea that the Milky Way's
                  dwarfs formed before reionization.},

  abstract =     {Dwarf galaxies pose substantial challenges for
                  cosmological models.  In particular, current models
                  predict a dark-matter density that is divergent at
                  the center, which is in sharp contrast with
                  observations that indicate a core of roughly
                  constant density. Energy feedback, from supernova
                  explosions and stellar winds, has been proposed as a
                  major factor shaping the evolution of dwarf
                  galaxies. We present detailed cosmological
                  simulations with sufficient resolution both to model
                  the relevant physical processes and to directly
                  assess the impact of stellar feedback on observable
                  properties of dwarf galaxies. We show that feedback
                  drives large-scale, bulk motions of the interstellar
                  gas, resulting in substantial gravitational
                  potential fluctuations and a consequent reduction in
                  the central matter density, bringing the theoretical
                  predictions in agreement with observations.},

                  drawn from 55.2 deg2 of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky
                  Survey (UKIDSS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
                  (SDSS) II Supernova Survey. Strong clustering is
                  detected for all the subsamples of massive galaxies
                  characterized by different stellar masses (M★=
                  1011.0-11.5 Msun, 1011.5-12.0 Msun) or rest-frame
                  colours (blue: U-V < 1.0, red: U-V > 1.0). We find
                  that more mature (more massive or redder) galaxies
                  are more clustered, which implies that the more
                  mature galaxies have started stellar-mass assembly
                  earlier within the highly biased region where the
                  structure formation has also started earlier. By
                  means of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models
                  fitted to the observed angular correlation function,
                  we infer the properties of the underlying host dark
                  haloes. We find that the estimated bias factors and
                  host halo masses are systematically larger for
                  galaxies with larger stellar masses, which is
                  consistent with the general agreement that the
                  capability of hosting massive galaxies depends
                  strongly on halo mass. The estimated effective halo
                  masses are ˜1014 Msun, which gives the stellar-mass
                  to halo-mass ratios of ˜0.003. The observed
                  evolution of bias factors indicates rapid evolution
                  of spatial distributions of cold dark matter
                  relative to those traced by the massive galaxies,
                  while the transition of host halo masses might imply
                  that the fractional mass growth rate of haloes is
                  less than those of stellar systems. The inferred
                  halo masses and high fractions of central galaxies
                  indicate that the massive galaxies in the current
                  sample are possibly equivalent to central galaxies
                  of galaxy clusters.},

                  0.34-0.84, similar to typical values found for
                  later-type spirals. The number of red GCs associated

                  luminosity, similar to what is observed for

                  dissipative processes, which are expected during

                  building luminous bulges of Sa galaxies, whereas
                  secular evolution may have played a larger role in
                  building lower-luminosity bulges in spirals.  Based

                  AGN feedback are able to successfully reproduce the
                  optical and X-ray properties of groups and low-mass
                  clusters. We isolate how, when and exactly what gas
                  is heated by AGN. Interestingly, we find that the
                  gas that constitutes the present-day IGrM is that
                  which was not strongly heated by AGN. Instead, the
                  low median density/high median entropy of the gas in
                  present-day groups is achieved by the ejection of
                  lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies
                  at high redshift (primarily 2 ≲z≲ 4). This
                  corresponds to the epoch when supermassive black
                  holes accreted most of their mass, typically at a
                  rate that is close to the Eddington limit (i.e. when
                  the black holes are in a 'quasar mode').},

                  importance of HD formation and cooling on the first
                  generation of metal-free stars in a ΛCDM
                  cosmology. We have implemented and tested
                  non-equilibrium HD chemistry in an adaptive mesh
                  refinement simulation code and applied it to two
                  situations. (1) It is first applied to the formation
                  of 105-106 Msolar halos which form in the absence of
                  any ionizing source (``unperturbed'' halos). We
                  show, in agreement with previous work, that HD
                  cooling is of only marginal importance for most
                  halos; however, we find that for the lowest mass
                  halos, with masses a few times 105 Msolar, HD
                  cooling can equal or surpass the H2 cooling
                  rate. This leads to a population of stars formed in
                  halos with effective HD cooling that are less
                  massive by a factor of ~6 compared to halos
                  dominated by H2 cooling. (2) In the second part of
                  the paper, we ionize the halos in order to explore
                  the impact of HD cooling in the presence of an ample
                  population of free electrons. This leads to cooler
                  temperatures (due to the electron-catalyzed
                  production of H2), implying somewhat lower resulting
                  protostellar mass. Adding HD chemistry changes this
                  by lowering the temperature further, to the level of
                  the CMB. We find that HD cooling dominates over H2
                  cooling in the density range 102-106 cm-3, but above
                  this density, the temperature rises and H2 cooling
                  dominates again. Because of this, the accretion rate
                  on to the protostar is almost the same as in the H2
                  case (at least for accreted masses below 50-100
                  Msolar) therefore we argue that HD cooling in
                  ionized halos will probably not result in a
                  population of significantly lower mass stars.},

                  find that in high-density regions ~70 per cent of
                  galaxies are passively evolving independent of
                  luminosity.  In the rarefied field, however, the
                  fraction of passively evolving galaxies is a strong
                  function of luminosity, dropping from 50 per cent
                  for Mr <~ -21 to zero by Mr ~ -18. Moreover the few
                  passively evolving dwarf galaxies in field regions
                  appear as satellites to bright (>~ L*)
                  galaxies. Moreover the fraction of galaxies with the
                  optical signatures of an active galactic nucleus
                  (AGN) decreases steadily from ~50 percent at Mr~-21 to ~0
                  per cent by Mr~-18 closely mirroring the luminosity
                  dependence of the passive galaxy fraction in
                  low-density environments (see fig. 1 continuous
                  lines). This result reflects the increasing
                  importance of AGN feedback with galaxy mass for
                  their evolution, such that the star formation
                  histories of massive galaxies are primarily

                  are easily reproduced with a steep mass spectrum of
                  thousands of substructure clumps that closely
                  matches the observations. However, the survival of
                  dark matter substructure also occurs on galactic
                  scales, leading to the remarkable result that galaxy
                  halos appear as scaled versions of galaxy
                  clusters. The model predicts that the virialized
                  extent of the Milky Way's halo should contain about
                  500 satellites with circular velocities larger than

  abstract =     {We show that a universe dominated by cold dark
                  matter fails to reproduce the rotation curves of
                  dark matter dominated galaxies, one of the key
                  problems that it was designed to resolve. We perform
                  numerical simulations of the formation of dark
                  matter haloes, each containing >~106 particles and
                  resolved to 0.003 times the virial radius, allowing
                  an accurate comparison with rotation curve data. A
                  good fit to both Galactic and cluster-sized haloes
                  can be achieved using the density profile
                  ρ(r)~[(rrs)1.5(1+(rrs)1.5)] -1, where rs is a scale
                  radius.  This profile has a steeper asymptotic
                  slope, ρ(r)~r-1.5, and a sharper turn-over than
                  found by lower resolution studies. The central
                  structure of relaxed haloes that form within a
                  hierarchical universe has a remarkably small
                  scatter. We compare the results with a sample of
                  dark matter dominated, low surface brightness (LSB)
                  galaxies with circular velocities in the range
                  100-300kms-1. The rotation curves of discs within
                  cold dark matter haloes rise too steeply to match
                  these data, which require a constant mass density in
                  the central regions. The effects of Ωmass and Λ
                  cannot reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) model
                  with data - even if we leave the concentration as a
                  free parameter, we are unable to reproduce the
                  observations with such a steep central density
                  profile. It is important to confirm these results
                  using stellar rather than Hi rotation curves for LSB
                  galaxies. We test the effects of introducing a
                  cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in a
                  universe dominated by warm dark matter.  In this
                  case, haloes form by a monolithic collapse but the
                  final density profile barely changes, demonstrating
                  that the merger history does not play a role in
                  determining the halo structure.},

                  the universe from expanding forever1 (producing
                  either a `flat' or a `closed' Universe)3. Several
                  models have been proposed to provide the dark matter
                  required within galaxy haloes for a flat universe,
                  of which cold dark matter (CDM) has proved the most
                  successful at reproducing the observed large-scale
                  structure of the Universe4-6. CDM belongs to a class
                  of non-relativistic particles that interact
                  primarily through gravity, and are named
                  dissipationless because they cannot dissipate energy
                  (baryonic particles can lose energy by emitting
                  electromagnetic radiation). Here I show that the
                  modelled small-scale properties of CDM7-9 are
                  fundamentally incompatible with recent
                  observations10-13 of dwarf galaxies, which are
                  thought to be completely dominated by dark matter on
                  scales larger than a kiloparsec. Thus, the
                  hypothesis that dark matter is predominantly cold
                  seems hard to sustain.},

  abstract =     {The friends-of-friends algorithm (hereafter FOF) is
                  a percolation algorithm which is routinely used to
                  identify dark matter halos from N-body
                  simulations. We use results from percolation theory
                  to show that the boundary of FOF halos does not
                  correspond to a single density threshold but to a
                  range of densities close to a critical value that
                  depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We
                  show that for the commonly used choice of b = 0.2,
                  this critical density is equal to 81.62 times the
                  mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified
                  by the FOF algorithm enclose an average overdensity
                  which depends on their density profile
                  (concentration) and therefore changes with halo
                  mass, contrary to the popular belief that the
                  average overdensity is ~180. We derive an analytical
                  expression for the overdensity as a function of the
                  linking length parameter b and the concentration of
                  the halo. Results of tests carried out using
                  simulated and actual FOF halos identified in
                  cosmological simulations show excellent agreement
                  with our analytical prediction. We also find that
                  the mass of the halo that the FOF algorithm selects
                  crucially depends upon mass resolution.  We find a
                  percolation-theory-motivated formula that is able to
                  accurately correct for the dependence on number of
                  particles for the mock realizations of spherical and
                  triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show
                  that this correction breaks down when applied to the
                  real cosmological FOF halos due to the presence of
                  substructures. Given that abundance of substructure
                  depends on redshift and cosmology, we expect that
                  the resolution effects due to substructure on the
                  FOF mass and halo mass function will also depend on
                  redshift and cosmology and will be difficult to
                  correct for in general. Finally, we discuss the
                  implications of our results for the universality of
                  the mass function.},

                  accurately describe the time evolution of the
                  concentration-mass (cvir-Mvir) relation since z=

  abstract =     {We run very large cosmological N-body hydrodynamical
                  simulations in order to study statistically the
                  baryon fractions in early dark matter haloes. We
                  critically examine how differences in the initial
                  conditions affect the gas fraction in the redshift
                  range z= 11-21. We test three different linear power
                  spectra for the initial conditions. (1) A complete
                  heating model, which is our fiducial model; this
                  model follows the evolution of overdensities
                  correctly, according to Naoz & Barkana (2005), in
                  particular including the spatial variation of the
                  speed of sound of the gas due to Compton heating
                  from the CMB. (2) An equal-δ model, which assumes
                  that the initial baryon fluctuations are equal to
                  those of the dark matter, while conserving σ8 of the
                  total matter.  (3) A mean cs model, which assumes a
                  uniform speed of sound of the gas. The latter two
                  models are often used in the literature. We
                  calculate the baryon fractions for a large sample of
                  haloes in our simulations.  Our fiducial model
                  implies that before reionization and significant
                  stellar heating took place, the minimum mass needed
                  for a minihalo to keep most of its baryons
                  throughout its formation was ˜3 × 104 Msun. However,
                  the alternative models yield a wrong (higher by
                  about 50 per cent) minimum mass, since the system
                  retains a memory of the initial conditions. We also
                  demonstrate this using the 'filtering mass' from
                  linear theory, which accurately describes the
                  evolution of the baryon fraction throughout the
                  simulated redshift range.},

  abstract =     {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study
                  the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter
                  halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We
                  find that all such profiles have the same shape,
                  independent of the halo mass, the initial density
                  fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the
                  cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged
                  equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two
                  decades in radius by a simple formula originally
                  proposed to describe the structure of galaxy
                  clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any
                  particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of
                  the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic
                  density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are
                  significantly denser than more massive systems, a
                  correlation that reflects the higher collapse
                  redshift of small halos. The characteristic density
                  of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the
                  density of the universe at the time it was
                  assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly
                  time allows the same proportionality constant to be
                  used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We
                  compare our results with previous work on halo
                  density profiles and show that there is good
                  agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic
                  procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism,
                  that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be
                  calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical

                  to study the properties of simulated galaxies at
                  z=2. We focus on the effect of feedback from
                  evolving stars on the baryonic mass and angular
                  momentum content of galaxies that assemble at the
                  center of 1011-1012 h-1Msun halos. Our main finding
                  is that the mass and angular momentum of such
                  galaxies are strongly coupled, in a way that is
                  approximately independent of feedback: varying the
                  feedback strength leads, in a given halo, to large
                  variations in galaxy mass but leaves the galaxy
                  mass-angular momentum correlation largely
                  unaltered. In particular, the ratio between the
                  angular momentum of a galaxy and that of its
                  surrounding halo (jd = Jgal / Jvir) correlates
                  closely with the galaxy mass (expressed in units of
                  the virial mass of the halo; md = Mgal / Mvir). This
                  correlation differs substantially from the md = jd
                  assumption commonly adopted in semianalytic models
                  of galaxy formation. We use these results to infer
                  the sizes of disk galaxies at z=2 expected in the
                  LCDM scenario and to interpret recent observations

  abstract =     {We develop a new formalism for modelling the
                  formation and evolution of galaxies within a
                  hierarchical universe. Similarly, to standard
                  semi-analytical models we trace galaxies inside dark
                  matter merger trees which are extracted from a large
                  N-body simulation. The formalism includes treatment
                  of feedback, star formation, cooling, smooth
                  accretion, gas stripping in satellite galaxies and
                  merger-induced starbursts.  However, unlike in other
                  models, each process is assumed to have an
                  efficiency which depends only on the host halo mass
                  and redshift.  This allows us to describe the
                  various components of the model in a simple and
                  transparent way. By allowing the efficiencies to
                  have any value for a given halo mass and redshift,
                  we can easily encompass a large range of
                  scenarios. To demonstrate this point, we examine
                  several different galaxy formation models, which are
                  all consistent with the observational data. Each
                  model is characterized by a different unique
                  feature: cold accretion in low-mass haloes, zero
                  feedback, stars formed only in merger-induced
                  bursts, and shutdown of star formation after
                  mergers. Using these models we are able to examine
                  the degeneracy inherent in galaxy formation models,
                  and look for observational data that will help to
                  break this degeneracy. We show that the full
                  distribution of star formation rates in a given
                  stellar mass bin is promising in constraining the
                  models. We compare our approach in detail to the
                  semi-analytical model of De Lucia & Blaizot.  It is
                  shown that our formalism is able to produce a very
                  similar population of galaxies once the same median
                  efficiencies per halo mass and redshift are being
                  used. Consequently, our approach may be useful for
                  comparing various published semi-analytical models
                  within the same framework. We provide a public
                  version of the model galaxies on our webpage along
                  with a tool for running models with user-defined
                  parameters. Our model is able to provide results for
                  a 62.5 h-1Mpc box within just a few seconds.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents further results from our
                  spectroscopic study of the globular cluster (GC)
                  system of the group elliptical NGC 3923.  From
                  observations made with the GMOS instrument on the
                  Gemini South telescope, an additional 50 GC and
                  Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) candidates have been
                  spectroscopically confirmed as members of the NGC
                  3923 system. When the recessional velocities of
                  these GCs are combined with the 29 GC velocities
                  reported previously, a total sample of 79 GC/UCD
                  velocities is produced. This sample extends to over
                  6 arcmin (>6 Re \sim30 kpc) from the centre of NGC
                  3923, and is used to study the dynamics of the GC
                  system and the dark matter content of NGC 3923. It
                  is found that the GC system of NGC 3923 displays no
                  appreciable rotation, and that the projected
                  velocity dispersion is constant with radius within
                  the uncertainties. The velocity dispersion profiles
                  of the integrated light and GC system of NGC 3923
                  are indistinguishable over the region in which they
                  overlap. We find some evidence that the diffuse
                  light and GCs of NGC 3923 have radially biased
                  orbits within \sim130". The application of
                  axisymmetric orbit-based models to the GC and
                  integrated light velocity dispersion profiles
                  demonstrates that a significant increase in the
                  mass-to-light ratio (from M/Lv = 8 to 26) at large
                  galactocentric radii is required to explain these
                  observations. We therefore confirm the presence of a
                  dark matter halo in NGC 3923. We find that dark
                  matter comprises 17.5 percent of the mass within 1 Re,
                  41.2 percent within 2 Re, and 75.6 percent within the radius of
                  our last kinematic tracer at 6.9 Re. The total
                  dynamical mass within this radius is found to be 1.5
                  x 10^12 solar masses. In common with other studies
                  of large ellipticals, we find that our derived
                  dynamical mass profile is consistently higher than
                  that derived by X-ray observations, by a factor of
                  around 2.},

                  cosmology and the observed dwarf galaxies sample
                  from the THINGS survey in terms of (1) the rotation
                  curve shape and (2) the logarithmic inner density
                  slope α of mass density profiles. The simulations,
                  which include the effect of baryonic feedback
                  processes, such as gas cooling, star formation,
                  cosmic UV background heating, and most importantly,
                  physically motivated gas outflows driven by
                  supernovae, form bulgeless galaxies with DM
                  cores. We show that the stellar and baryonic mass is
                  similar to that inferred from photometric and
                  kinematic methods for galaxies of similar circular
                  velocity. Analyzing the simulations in exactly the
                  same way as the observational sample allows us to
                  address directly the so-called cusp/core problem in
                  the ΛCDM model. We show that the rotation curves of
                  the simulated dwarf galaxies rise less steeply than
                  cold dark matter rotation curves and are consistent
                  with those of the THINGS dwarf galaxies. The mean
                  value of the logarithmic inner density slopes α of
                  the simulated galaxies' DM density profiles is ~-0.4
                  ± 0.1, which shows good agreement with α = -0.29 ±
                  0.07 of the THINGS dwarf galaxies. The effect of
                  non-circular motions is not significant enough to
                  affect the results. This confirms that the baryonic
                  feedback processes included in the simulations are
                  efficiently able to make the initial cusps with α
                  -1.0 to -1.5 predicted by DM-only simulations
                  shallower and induce DM halos with a central mass

  abstract =     {The first generation of stars is thought to have
                  formed in low-mass halos with Tvir<104 K where H2
                  cooling is paramount. However, the efficiency of H2
                  formation and cooling in these halos may have been
                  severely limited by feedback processes. In this
                  paper we investigate the radiative cooling and
                  collapse of halos with virial temperatures Tvir>104
                  K, i.e., those that can cool in the absence of H2
                  via neutral atomic lines. The evolution of these
                  halos differs from their less massive
                  counterparts. Efficient atomic line radiation allows
                  rapid cooling to ~8000 K; subsequently the gas can
                  contract nearly isothermally at this temperature. In
                  the absence of H2 molecules, the gas would likely
                  settle into a locally stable disk, and only disks
                  with unusually low spin would be unstable. However,
                  we find that the initial atomic line cooling leaves
                  a large, out-of-equilibrium residual free electron
                  fraction. This allows the molecular fraction to
                  build up to a universal value of xH2~10-3, almost
                  independently of initial density and temperature.
                  We show that this is a nonequilibrium freeze-out
                  value that can be understood in terms of timescale
                  arguments. Unlike in less massive halos, H2
                  formation and cooling is largely impervious to
                  feedback from external UV fields, due to the high
                  initial densities achieved by atomic cooling. The
                  newly formed molecules cool the gas further to ~100
                  K and allow the gas to fragment on scales of a few
                  times 100 Msolar. We investigate the importance of
                  various feedback effects such as H2
                  photodissociation from internal UV fields and
                  radiation pressure due to Lyα photon trapping, which
                  are likely to regulate the efficiency of star
                  formation.},

  abstract =     {More than half of nearby disc galaxies have
                  pseudobulges instead of classical bulges that are
                  though to be end-products of galaxy mergers.
                  Pseudobulges are presumed to develop overtime as a
                  result of secular evolution of galaxy discs. We
                  report simulations of galaxy formation, in which two
                  disc galaxies with disky pseudobulges have
                  formed. Based on the profile decomposition, the
                  bulge-to-total mass ratio of the simulated galaxies
                  is 0.6 for one galaxy and 0.3 for the other. We find
                  that the main formation mechanism of the
                  pseudobulges in our simulations is not the secular
                  evolution of discs but high-redshift starbursts. The
                  progenitors of the pseudobulges form as
                  high-redshift discs with small scale lengths by
                  rapid supply of low angular momentum gas. The
                  orientation of the high-redshift progenitors rapidly
                  changes by the change of the direction of the
                  angular momentum of newly-accreted gas, which blurs
                  the disc properties of the high-redshift discs.
                  Energetic winds following the starbursts remove low
                  angular momentum gas and quench the bulge
                  formation. Once the host haloes are well
                  established, the direction of the angular momentum
                  of newly-accreted gas is better aligned, and high
                  angular momentum gas forms discs with large scale
                  lengths. By redshift 2, before the main disc
                  formation, pseudobulge formation has largely
                  completed in terms of mass. The secular evolution
                  such as bar instability accounts for about 30 percent of
                  the bulge mass for one galaxy and only 13 percent for the
                  other but does affect the final shape and kinematic
                  properties of the pseudobulges.},

  abstract =     {Dark matter, proposed decades ago as a speculative
                  component of the universe, is now known to be the
                  vital ingredient in the cosmos: six times more
                  abundant than ordinary matter, one-quarter of the
                  total energy density, and the component that has
                  controlled the growth of structure in the
                  universe. Its nature remains a mystery, but assuming
                  that it is composed of weakly interacting subatomic

                  structures in the universe. Part 2 describes the
                  theory of gravitational instability in both the
                  linear and nonlinear regimes.  This part also
                  includes chapters on the microwave background

                  stars affects the assembly of the first dwarf
                  galaxies. To this end we perform cosmological zoomed
                  smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of a
                  dwarf galaxy assembling inside a halo reaching a
                  virial mass 10^9 solar at z = 10. The simulations
                  follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling of
                  primordial gas and the subsequent conversion of the
                  gas into metal-free stars. To quantify the radiative
                  feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars
                  emit both molecular hydrogen dissociating and
                  hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation with a simulation
                  in which stars emit only molecular hydrogen
                  dissociating radiation, and further with a
                  simulation in which stars remain
                  dark. Photodissociation and photoionization exert a
                  strong negative feedback on the assembly of the
                  galaxy inside the main minihalo progenitor. Gas
                  condensation is strongly impeded, and star formation
                  is strongly suppressed in comparison with the
                  simulation in which stars remain dark. The feedback
                  on the gas implies a suppression of the central dark
                  matter densities in the minihalo progenitor by
                  factors of up to a few, which is a significant
                  deviation from the singular isothermal density
                  profile characterizing the dark matter distribution
                  inside the virial radius in the absence of radiative
                  feedback. The evolution of gas densities, star
                  formation rates, and the distribution of dark matter
                  becomes insensitive to the inclusion of dissociating
                  radiation in the late stages of the minihalo
                  assembly, and it becomes insensitive to the
                  inclusion of ionizing radiation once the minihalo
                  turns into an atomically cooling galaxy. The
                  formation of an extended disk inside the dwarf
                  galaxy is a robust outcome not affected by the
                  inclusion of radiation. We estimate that dwarf
                  galaxies such as simulated here will be among the
                  faintest galaxies the upcoming James Webb Space
                  Telescope will detect.},

                  are affected by environment for the lowest mass
                  galaxies. On average, dwarfs in the outer regions of

                  satellites with their dark matter host has been
                  accumulating steadily over the past few years. The
                  effect is seen over a wide range of scales, from
                  massive clusters of galaxies down to galaxy-sized
                  systems, yet the underlying physical mechanism has
                  still not been established. To this end, we have
                  carried out a detailed analysis of the shapes and
                  orientations of dark matter substructures in
                  high-resolution N-body cosmological simulations. We
                  find a strong tendency for radial alignment of the
                  substructure with its host halo: the distribution of
                  halo major axes is very anisotropic, with the
                  majority pointing toward the center of mass of the
                  host. The alignment peaks once the subhalo has
                  passed the virial radius of the host for the first
                  time, but is not subsequently diluted, even after
                  the halos have gone through as many as four
                  pericentric passages. This evidence points to the
                  existence of a very rapid dynamical mechanism acting
                  on these systems, and we argue that tidal torquing
                  throughout their orbits is the most likely

                  peculiar velocities.  Two mechanisms are thought to
                  contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both of
                  which involve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In
                  the binary supernova scenario, a runaway star
                  receives its velocity when its binary massive
                  companion explodes as a supernova (SN). In the
                  alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway
                  stars are formed through gravitational interactions
                  between stars and binaries in dense, compact
                  clusters or cluster cores. Here we study the
                  ejection scenario. We make use of extensive N-body
                  simulations of massive clusters, as well as analytic
                  arguments, in order to characterize the expected
                  ejection velocity distribution of runaway stars. We
                  find that the ejection velocity distribution of the
                  fastest runaways (v >~ 80 km s-1) depends on the
                  binary distribution in the cluster, consistent with
                  our analytic toy model, whereas the distribution of
                  lower velocity runaways appears independent of the
                  binaries' properties.  For a realistic log constant
                  distribution of binary separations, we find the
                  velocity distribution to follow a simple power law:
                  Γ(v)vpropv -8/3 for the high-velocity runaways and v
                  -3/2 for the low-velocity ones. We calculate the
                  total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from
                  our simulated massive clusters and explore their
                  mass function and their binarity. The mass function
                  of runaway stars is biased toward high masses and
                  strongly depends on their velocity. The binarity of
                  runaways is a decreasing function of their ejection
                  velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected
                  with v > 150 km s-1. We also find that
                  hyper-runaways with velocities of hundreds of km s-1
                  can be dynamically ejected from stellar clusters,
                  but only at very low rates, which cannot account for
                  a significant fraction of the observed population of
                  hyper-velocity stars in the Galactic halo.},

                  formation that simultaneously follow radiative
                  transfer of hydrogen-ionizing photons, based on the
                  optically thin variable Eddington tensor
                  approximation as implemented in the GADGET code. We
                  consider only star-forming galaxies as sources and
                  examine to what extent they can yield a reasonable
                  reionization history and thermal state of the
                  intergalactic medium at redshifts around z˜ 3. This
                  serves as an important benchmark for our
                  self-consistent methodology to simulate galaxy
                  formation and reionization, and for future
                  improvements through accounting of other sources and
                  other wavelength ranges. We find that star formation
                  alone is sufficient for reionizing the Universe by
                  redshift z˜ 6. For a suitable choice of the escape
                  fraction and the heating efficiency, our models are
                  approximately able to account at the same time for
                  the one-point function and the power spectrum of the
                  Lyman α forest. The radiation field has an important
                  impact on the star formation rate density in our
                  simulations and significantly lowers the gaseous and
                  stellar fractions in low-mass dark matter
                  haloes. Our results thus directly demonstrate the
                  importance of radiative feedback for galaxy
                  formation.  The spatial and temporal importance of
                  this effect can be studied accurately with the
                  modelling technique explored here, allowing more
                  faithful simulations of galaxy formation.},

  abstract =     {In a companion paper (Paper I) we have proposed a
                  new candidate to account for the dark matter around
                  spiral galaxies: cold H_2_ gas in a fractal
                  structure, supported by rotation, and concomitant
                  with the HI disc. We have shown that this hypothesis
                  is compatible with dynamical and observational
                  constraints about disc galaxies, and explains
                  several conspiracies and paradoxes, since the dark
                  matter is then in a form of fresh gas able to
                  produce stars. In this paper we attempt to describe
                  the physical conditions leading to a fractal state
                  of cold gas in outer galaxy discs. Gas cloud models
                  taking into account the recently disclosed fractal
                  structure of cold gas are set up, showing that large
                  errors in the classical gas mass determination based
                  on smooth cloud models can easily follow if the gas
                  is in reality fractal. Indeed the range of possible
                  column densities is then much larger, including 5 or
                  more decades of surface densities, instead of 2 for
                  smooth cloud models. Thus fractal clouds must
                  present both optically thin and optically thick
                  clumps in any single wavelength observations. The
                  observed fractal dimension of the cold ISM suggests
                  that mass underestimates by a factor 10 or more are
                  typical. Due to its low temperature (around 3K), and
                  its condensed fractal structure, together with its
                  low metallicity, the outer gas would be almost
                  invisible for usual detectors. We consider the
                  paradox of the persistence of cold Jeans unstable
                  gas in outer discs, far from important heating
                  sources, yet not forming stars or
                  Jupiters. Following Rees (1976), we determine the
                  smallest clump distribution that can persist in a
                  collisional and almost isothermal fragmenting cold
                  gas. At 3K these elementary cloudlets are predicted
                  to have a radius of about 30AU, and have a mass of
                  the order of a Jupiter. Their average density and
                  column density are 10^9^cm^-3^ and
                  10^24^cm^-2^. They are gravitationally bound, and
                  their line of sight thermal width is about
                  0.1kms^-1^.  Their frequent collisions prevent them
                  from forming Jupiters or stars and the near
                  isothermality of the fractal nearly suppresses
                  energy dissipation. At higher temperature,
                  especially above H_2_ dissociation, the collision
                  rate in the fractal decreases, favouring star
                  formation.  It turns out that the smallest density
                  condensations, called "clumpuscules" offer
                  favourable conditions for containing H_2_ in both
                  vapour and solid phases. However it is unknown
                  whether enough condensations sites such as dust
                  exist in the outer discs to permit the freezing of
                  H_2_. It is expected that the large sublimation
                  energy prevents much H_2_ to become solid, but a
                  small amount of H_2_ ice grains is a crucial factor
                  for a good coupling between gas and the 3K
                  background.  Many of the general arguments presented
                  here about fractals can be applied to other
                  inhomogeneous structures, such as the hot gas in
                  galaxy clusters. The clumpuscules presented here
                  might be the form of matter in which cooling flows
                  in clusters seem to disappear.},

                  intricate filigree of clusters, filaments, sheets
                  and voids, the cosmic web. For the understanding of
                  its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial
                  to identify objectively its complex morphological
                  components. One of the most characteristic aspects
                  is that of the dominant underdense voids, the
                  product of a hierarchical process driven by the
                  collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging
                  of large ones.  In this study we present an
                  objective void finder technique which involves a
                  minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure
                  and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the
                  watershed void finder (WVF), is based upon the
                  watershed transform, a well-known technique for the
                  segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique
                  has the potential to trace the existing
                  manifestations of a void hierarchy.  The basic
                  watershed transform is augmented by a variety of
                  correction procedures to remove spurious structure
                  resulting from sampling noise.  This study contains
                  a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate
                  how it is able to trace and identify, relatively
                  parameter free, voids and their surrounding
                  (filamentary and planar) boundaries.  We test the
                  technique on a set of kinematic Voronoi models,
                  heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution
                  of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of
                  low-noise and high-noise Voronoi models with the
                  quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the
                  intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size
                  and shape of the voids are successfully
                  retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full
                  void size distribution function.},

                  approximations which are inappropriate in the
                  rapidly-changing limit. In the new picture, outflows
                  and galactic fountains can both give rise to
                  cusp-flattening.  Concentrations of baryons
                  undergoing cycles of rapid expansion and recollapse
                  are the essential ingredient. Constant density dark
                  matter cores should therefore be generated in
                  systems of a wide mass range if central starbursts
                  or AGN phases are sufficiently frequent and

  abstract =     {We investigate the cross-talk between the two key
                  components of tidal-torque theory, the inertia ( I )
                  and shear ( T ) tensors, using a cosmological N
                  -body simulation with thousands of well-resolved
                  haloes. We find that the principal axes of I and T
                  are strongly aligned , even though I characterizes
                  the protohalo locally while T is determined by the
                  large-scale structure. Thus, the resultant galactic
                  spin, which plays a key role in galaxy formation, is
                  only a residual due to ~10 per cent deviations from
                  the perfect alignment of T and I . The T - I
                  correlation induces a weak tendency for the
                  protohalo spin to be perpendicular to the major axes
                  of T and I , but this correlation is erased by
                  non-linear effects at late times, making the
                  observed spins poor indicators of the initial shear
                  field. However, the T - I correlation implies that
                  the shear tensor can be used for identifying the
                  positions and boundaries of protohaloes in
                  cosmological initial conditions - a missing piece in
                  galaxy formation theory. The typical configuration
                  is of a prolate protohalo lying perpendicular to a
                  large-scale high-density ridge, with the surrounding
                  voids inducing compression along the major and
                  intermediate inertia axes of the protohalo. This
                  leads to a transient sub-halo filament along the
                  large-scale ridge, whose subclumps then flow along
                  the filament and merge into the final halo. The
                  centres of protohaloes tend to lie in ~1σ
                  overdensity regions, but their association with
                  linear density maxima smoothed on galactic scales is
                  vague: only ~40 per cent of the protohaloes contain
                  peaks. Several other characteristics distinguish
                  protohaloes from density peaks, e.g. they tend to
                  compress along two principal axes while many peaks
                  compress along three axes.},

                  well-resolved haloes. The protohaloes are identified
                  by tracing today's haloes back to the initial
                  conditions. The TTT predictions for the protohaloes
                  match, on average, the spin amplitudes of the
                  virialized haloes of today, if linear growth is
                  assumed until ~t 0 /3, or 55-70 per cent of the halo
                  effective turn-around time. This makes it a useful
                  qualitative tool for understanding certain average
                  properties of galaxies, such as total spin and
                  angular momentum distribution within haloes, but
                  with a random scatter of the order of the signal
                  itself. Non-linear changes in spin direction cause a
                  mean error of ~50° in the TTT prediction at t 0 ,
                  such that the linear spatial correlations of spins
                  on scales >=1h -1 Mpc are significantly weakened by
                  non-linear effects. This questions the usefulness of
                  TTT for predicting intrinsic alignments in the
                  context of gravitational lensing. We find that the
                  standard approximations made in TTT, including a
                  second-order expansion of the Zel'dovich potential
                  and a smoothing of the tidal field, provide

                  a statistical method for identifying such subsystems
                  within a magnitude-limited redshift catalog which is
                  complete in some solid angle of sky. The method is
                  tested on simulated catalogs derived from N-body
                  simulations, and is found to yield stable mass
                  estimates over a large range of values of the ratio
                  of clustered density to critical density in the
                  sampled volume, with only a small statistical
                  estimator bias (which is calibrated out by these

                  density cusp in the dark matter profile into a
                  near-constant density core. This may then provide
                  the missing link between current cosmological
                  simulations, which predict a central cusp in the
                  dark matter density profile, and current
                  observations, which find much shallower central
                  density profiles.  We also look at the angular
                  momentum history of dSphs and demonstrate that if
                  these galaxies have spent most of their lifetime in
                  tidal isolation from massive galaxies then they
                  cannot have formed from high angular momentum gas

  abstract =     {We explore the cosmological halo-to-halo scatter of
                  the distribution of mass within dark matter haloes
                  utilizing a well-resolved statistical sample of
                  clusters from the cosmological Millennium
                  Simulation. We find that at any radius, the
                  spherically averaged dark matter density of a halo
                  (corresponding to the 'smooth component') and its
                  logarithmic slope are well described by a Gaussian
                  probability distribution.  At small radii (within
                  the scale radius), the density distribution is fully
                  determined by the measured Gaussian distribution in
                  halo concentrations. The variance in the radial
                  distribution of mass in dark matter haloes is
                  important for the interpretation of direct and
                  indirect dark matter detection efforts. The scatter
                  in mass profiles imparts approximately a 25 per cent
                  cosmological uncertainty in the dark matter density
                  at the Solar neighbourhood and a factor of ˜3
                  uncertainty in the expected Galactic dark matter
                  annihilation flux.  The aggregate effect of
                  halo-to-halo profile scatter leads to a small (few
                  per cent) enhancement in dark matter annihilation
                  background if the Gaussian concentration
                  distribution holds for all halo masses versus a 10
                  per cent enhancement under the assumption of a
                  lognormal concentration distribution. The Gaussian
                  nature of the cluster profile scatter implies that
                  the technique of 'stacking' haloes to improve
                  signal-to-noise ratio should not suffer from bias.},

  abstract =     {The evolution of compact groups of galaxies may
                  represent one of the few places in the nearby
                  universe in which massive galaxies are being forged
                  through a complex set of processes involving tidal
                  interaction, ram-pressure stripping, and perhaps
                  finally "dry mergers" of galaxies stripped of their
                  cool gas. Using collisionless N-body simulations, we
                  propose a possible scenario for the formation of one
                  of the best-studied compact groups: Stephan's
                  Quintet. We define a serial approach which allows us
                  to consider the history of the group as a sequence
                  of galaxy-galaxy interactions seen as relatively
                  separate events in time, but chained together in
                  such a way as to provide a plausible scenario that
                  ends in the current configuration of the
                  galaxies. By covering a large set of parameters, we
                  claim that it is very unlikely that both major tidal
                  tails of the group have been created by the
                  interaction between the main galaxy and a single
                  intruder. We propose instead a scenario based on two
                  satellites orbiting the main disk, plus the recent
                  involvement of an additional interloper, coming from
                  the background at high speed.  This purely N-body
                  study of the quintet will provide a parameter-space
                  exploration of the basic dynamics of the group that
                  can be used as a basis for a more sophisticated
                  N-body/hydrodynamic study of the group that is
                  necessary to explain the giant shock structure and
                  other purely gaseous phenomena observed in both the
                  cold, warm and hot gas in the group.},

                  the global morphology of the progenitors and give
                  birth to the long stellar, gaseous and dusty tails
                  often observed. In addition to this destructive
                  effect, tidal forces can morph into a transient,
                  protective setting called compressive mode. Such
                  modes then shelter the matter in their midst by
                  increasing its gravitational binding energy. This
                  thesis focuses on the study of this poorly known
                  regime by quantifying its properties thanks to
                  numerical and analytical tools applied to a
                  spectacular merging system of two galaxies, commonly
                  known as the Antennae galaxies.  N-body simulations
                  of this pair yield compressive modes in the regions
                  where observations reveal a burst of star
                  formation. Furthermore, characteristic time- and
                  energy scales of these modes match well those of
                  self-gravitating substructures such as star clusters
                  and tidal dwarf galaxies. These results suggest that
                  the compressive modes of tidal fields plays an
                  important role in the formation and evolution of
                  young clusters, at least in a statistical sense,
                  over a lapse of ~10 million years. Preliminary
                  results from simulations of stellar associations
                  highlight the importance of embedding the clusters
                  in the evolving background galaxies to account
                  precisely for their morphology and internal

                  measurements of low-redshift quasars have unveiled a
                  population of intervening broad H i Ly α absorbers
                  (BLAs) with large Doppler parameters (b≥ 40 km
                  s-1). If the large width of these lines is dominated
                  by thermal line broadening, the BLAs may trace
                  highly-ionized gas in the warm-hot intergalactic
                  medium (WHIM) in the temperature range T≈ 10^5{-}106
                  K, a gas phase that is expected to contain a large
                  fraction of the baryons at low redshift. In this
                  paper we use a hydrodynamical simulation to study
                  frequency, distribution, physical conditions, and
                  baryon content of the BLAs at z≈ 0. From our
                  simulated spectra we derive a number of BLAs per
                  unit redshift of (dN/dz)_BLA≈ 38 for H i absorbers
                  with log (N(cm-2)/b(km s-1))≥ 10.7, b≥40 km s-1, and
                  total hydrogen column densities N(H ii)≤ 1020.5
                  cm-2. The baryon content of these systems is
                  Ω_b(BLA)=0.0121 h65 -1, which represents ˜ 25
                  percent of the total baryon budget in our
                  simulation. Our results thus support the idea that
                  BLAs represent a significant baryon reservoir at low
                  redshift.  BLAs predominantly trace shock-heated
                  collisionally ionized WHIM gas at temperatures log
                  T≈ 4.4{-}6.2. About 27 percent of the BLAs in our
                  simulation originate in the photoionized Ly α forest
                  (log T<4.3) and their large line widths are
                  determined by non-thermal broadening effects such as
                  unresolved velocity structure and macroscopic
                  turbulence. Our simulation implies that for a
                  large-enough sample of BLAs in FUV spectra it is
                  possible to obtain a reasonable approximation of the
                  baryon content of these systems solely from the
                  measured H i column densities and b values.},

  abstract =     {Several recent studies suggest a correlation between
                  dark matter halo mass and the shape of the density
                  profile. We reanalyze simulations from Ricotti in
                  which such a correlation was first proposed. We use
                  a standard analysis of the halo density profiles and
                  compare the old simulations to new ones performed
                  with Gadget2, including higher resolution runs. We
                  confirm Ricotti's result that, at virialization, the
                  central log slopes α, at 5-10 percent of the virial
                  radius, are correlated with the halo mass and that
                  the halo concentration is a universal constant. Our
                  results do not contradict the majority of published
                  papers: when using a split power law to fit the
                  density profiles, due to the α-c degeneracy, the
                  fits are consistent with halos having a universal
                  shape with α=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend
                  on the mass, in agreement with results published
                  elsewhere. Recently, several groups have found no
                  evidence for convergence of the inner halo profile
                  to a constant power law. The choice of the split
                  power-law parameterization used in this Letter is
                  motivated by the need to compare our results to
                  previous ones and is formally valid because we are
                  not able to resolve regions where the slope of the
                  fitting function reaches its asymptotic constant
                  value. Using a nonparameterized technique, we also
                  show that the density profiles of dwarf galaxies at
                  z~10 have a log slope shallower than 0.5 within 5 percent
                  of the virial radius.},

                  on the scale-free nature of clustering that leads to
                  a statistically self-similar distribution of the

  abstract =     {There are a number of different phenomena in the
                  early universe that have to be studied numerically
                  with lattice simulations. This paper presents a
                  graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated Python
                  program called PyCOOL that solves the evolution of
                  scalar fields in a lattice with very precise
                  symplectic integrators. The program has been written
                  with the intention to hit a sweet spot of speed,
                  accuracy and user friendliness. This has been
                  achieved by using the Python language with the
                  PyCUDA interface to make a program that is easy to
                  adapt to different scalar field models. In this
                  paper we derive the symplectic dynamics that govern
                  the evolution of the system and then present the
                  implementation of the program in Python and
                  PyCUDA. The functionality of the program is tested
                  in a chaotic inflation preheating model, a single
                  field oscillon case and in a supersymmetric curvaton
                  model which leads to Q-ball production. We have also
                  compared the performance of a consumer graphics card
                  to a professional Tesla compute card in these
                  simulations. We find that the program is not only
                  accurate but also very fast. To further increase the
                  usefulness of the program we have equipped it with
                  numerous post-processing functions that provide
                  useful information about the cosmological
                  model. These include various spectra and statistics
                  of the fields. The program can be additionally used
                  to calculate the generated curvature perturbation.

                  galaxies using cosmological N-body/gasdynamical runs
                  from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS)
                  project. The runs contrast several feedback
                  implementations of varying effectiveness: from no
                  feedback, to supernova-driven winds to powerful
                  active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven outflows. These
                  different feedback models result in large variations
                  in the abundance and structural properties of bright
                  galaxies at z= 2. In agreement with earlier work,
                  models with inefficient or no feedback lead to the
                  formation of massive compact galaxies collecting a
                  large fraction (upwards of 50 per cent) of all
                  available baryons in each halo. Increasing the
                  efficiency of feedback reduces the baryonic mass and
                  increases the size of simulated galaxies. A model
                  that includes supernova-driven gas outflows aided by
                  the energetic output of AGNs reduces galaxy masses
                  by roughly a factor of ˜10 compared with the
                  no-feedback case.  Other models give results that
                  straddle these two extremes. Despite the large
                  differences in galaxy formation efficiency, the net
                  specific angular momentum of a galaxy is, on
                  average, roughly half that of its surrounding halo,
                  independent of halo mass (in the range probed) and
                  of the feedback scheme. Feedback thus affects the
                  baryonic mass of a galaxy much more severely than
                  its spin. Feedback induces strong correlations
                  between angular momentum content and galaxy mass
                  that leave their imprint on galaxy scaling relations
                  and morphologies.  Encouragingly, we find that
                  galaxy discs are common in moderate-feedback runs,
                  making up typically ˜50 per cent of all galaxies at
                  the centres of haloes with virial mass exceeding
                  ˜1011 Msun. The size, stellar masses and circular
                  speeds of simulated galaxies formed in such runs
                  have properties in between those of large
                  star-forming discs and of compact early-type
                  galaxies at z= 2. Once the detailed abundance and
                  structural properties of these rare objects are well
                  established, it may be possible to use them to gauge
                  the overall efficacy of feedback in the formation of
                  high-redshift galaxies.},

                  cosmological simulation of a Milky Way sized halo
                  and its environment. Our simulation includes gas
                  cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, metal
                  enrichment and ultraviolet heating. In total, 90
                  satellites and more than 400 isolated dwarf galaxies
                  are formed in the simulation, allowing a systematic
                  study of the internal and environmental processes
                  that determine their evolution. We find that 95 per
                  cent of satellite galaxies are gas free at z= 0, and
                  identify three mechanisms for gas loss: supernova
                  feedback, tidal stripping and photoevaporation due
                  to re-ionization.  Gas-rich satellite galaxies are
                  only found with total masses above ˜5 × 109 Msun. In
                  contrast, for isolated dwarf galaxies, a total mass
                  of ˜109 Msun constitutes a sharp transition; less
                  massive galaxies are predominantly gas free at z= 0,
                  more massive, isolated dwarf galaxies are often able
                  to retain their gas. In general, we find that the
                  total mass of a dwarf galaxy is the main factor
                  which determines its star formation, metal
                  enrichment and its gas content, but that stripping
                  may explain the observed difference in gas content
                  between field dwarf galaxies and satellites with
                  total masses close to 109 Msun. We also find that a
                  morphological transformation via tidal stripping of
                  infalling, luminous dwarf galaxies whose dark matter
                  is less concentrated than their stars cannot explain
                  the high total mass-to-light ratios of the faint

                  matter (ΛCDM) universe using high-resolution
                  hydrodynamical simulations with a multiphase
                  treatment of gas, cooling and feedback, focusing on
                  the formation of discs. Our simulations follow eight
                  isolated haloes similar in mass to the Milky Way and
                  extracted from a large cosmological simulation
                  without restriction on spin parameter or merger
                  history.  This allows us to investigate how the
                  final properties of the simulated galaxies correlate
                  with the formation histories of their haloes.  We
                  find that, at z = 0, none of our galaxies contains a
                  disc with more than 20 per cent of its total stellar
                  mass. Four of the eight galaxies nevertheless have
                  well-formed disc components, three have dominant
                  spheroids and very small discs, and one is a
                  spheroidal galaxy with no disc at all. The z = 0
                  spheroids are made of old stars, while discs are
                  younger and formed from the inside-out. Neither the
                  existence of a disc at z = 0 nor the final
                  disc-to-total mass ratio seems to depend on the spin
                  parameter of the halo. Discs are formed in haloes
                  with spin parameters as low as 0.01 and as high as
                  0.05; galaxies with little or no disc component span
                  the same range in spin parameter. Except for one of
                  the simulated galaxies, all have significant discs
                  at z >~ 2, regardless of their z = 0 morphologies.
                  Major mergers and instabilities which arise when
                  accreting cold gas is misaligned with the stellar
                  disc trigger a transfer of mass from the discs to
                  the spheroids. In some cases, discs are destroyed,
                  while in others, they survive or reform. This
                  suggests that the survival probability of discs
                  depends on the particular formation history of each
                  galaxy. A realistic ΛCDM model will clearly require
                  weaker star formation at high redshift and later
                  disc assembly than occurs in our models.},

                  stochastic process describing the initial conditions
                  treats both the tidal shear as well as the inertia
                  as dynamical fields and explicitly accounts for the
                  discreteness of the inertia field. We describe the
                  way in which the correlations in angular momentum
                  result from an interplay of long-ranged correlations
                  in the tidal shear, and short ranged correlations in

                  measure the escape velocity and mass profiles of
                  galaxy clusters to clustrocentric distances well
                  beyond the virial radius, where dynamical
                  equilibrium does not necessarily hold. We provide a
                  detailed description of this technique and analyse
                  its possible systematic errors. We apply the caustic
                  technique to clusters with mass M200≥ 1014 h-1 Msun
                  extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamic
                  simulation of a ΛCDM universe. With a few tens of
                  redshifts per squared comoving megaparsec within the
                  cluster, the caustic technique, on average, recovers
                  the profile of the escape velocity from the cluster
                  with better than 10 per cent accuracy up to r˜
                  4r200. The caustic technique also recovers the mass
                  profile with better than 10 per cent accuracy in the
                  range (0.6-4) r200, but it overestimates the mass up
                  to 70 per cent at smaller radii. This overestimate
                  is a consequence of neglecting the radial dependence
                  of the filling function ?. The 1σ uncertainty on
                  individual escape velocity profiles increases from
                  ˜20 to ˜50 per cent when the radius increases from
                  r˜ 0.1r200 to ˜4r200. Individual mass profiles have
                  1σ uncertainty between 40 and 80 per cent within the
                  radial range (0.6-4) r200. When the correct virial
                  mass is known, the 1σ uncertainty reduces to a
                  constant 50 per cent on the same radial range. We
                  show that the amplitude of these uncertainties is
                  completely due to the assumption of spherical
                  symmetry, which is difficult to drop. Other
                  potential refinements of the technique are not
                  crucial.  We conclude that, when applied to
                  individual clusters, the caustic technique generally
                  provides accurate escape velocity and mass profiles,
                  although, in some cases, the deviation from the real
                  profile can be substantial. Alternatively, we can
                  apply the technique to synthetic clusters obtained
                  by stacking individual clusters: in this case, the
                  1σ uncertainty on the escape velocity profile is
                  smaller than 20 per cent out to 4r200. The caustic
                  technique thus provides reliable average profiles
                  which extend to regions difficult or impossible to
                  probe with other techniques.},

                  Initially small-amplitude density fluctuations of
                  Gaussian type transform into thin dense pancakes,
                  filaments, and compact clumps of matter.  It is
                  perhaps surprising that the motion of
                  self-gravitating matter in the expanding universe is
                  like that of noninteracting matter moving by
                  inertia. A similar process is the distribution of
                  light reflected or refracted from rippled water. The
                  similarity of gravitational instability to acoustic
                  turbulence is highlighted by the fact that late
                  nonlinear stages of density perturbation growth can
                  be described by the Burgers equation, which is well

                  waves in a gas of primordial composition have been
                  calculated in detail for a number of cases.  The
                  authors have solved the rate equations for these
                  processes, together with the hydrodynamical
                  conservation equations. Such shock waves are
                  relevant to a wide range of theories of galaxy and
                  pregalactic star formation. A purely atomic gas of H
                  and He which is shock-heated to temperatures above
                  104K is assumed. The results indicate that formation
                  of H2 molecules in the post-shock gas may be quite
                  common for a significant range of shock
                  velocities. The extra cooling resulting from H2
                  formation greatly reduces previous estimates of the

  abstract =     {We report results of a series of nonradiative
                  N-body/SPH simulations in a ΛCDM cosmology, designed
                  to study the growth of angular momentum in galaxy
                  systems. A sample of 41 halos of differing mass and
                  environment were selected from a cosmological N-body
                  simulation of size 32.5 h-1 Mpc and resimulated at
                  higher resolution with the tree-SPH code GADGET. We
                  find that the spin of the baryonic component
                  correlates well with the spin of the dark matter,
                  but there is a misalignment of typically 20° between
                  these two components. The spin of the baryonic
                  component is also on average larger than that of the
                  dark matter component, and we find this effect to be
                  more pronounced at lower redshifts. A significant
                  fraction f of gas has negative angular momentum, and
                  this fraction is found to increase with
                  redshift. This trend can be explained as a result of
                  increasing thermalization of the virializing gas
                  with decreasing redshift. We describe a toy model in
                  which the tangential velocities of particles are
                  smeared by Gaussian random motions. This model is
                  successful in explaining some of the global angular
                  momentum properties, in particular the
                  anticorrelation of f with the spin parameter λ and
                  the shape of the angular momentum distributions
                  (AMDs). We investigate in detail the AMDs of the gas
                  and the dark matter components of the halo. We
                  compare and contrast various techniques to determine
                  the AMDs. We show that the technique of adding
                  thermal velocities to streaming motions (broadening)
                  is unsuitable for making comparisons between gas and
                  dark matter AMDs because the shape of the broadened
                  AMDs is predominantly determined by the dispersion
                  and is insensitive to the underlying nonbroadened
                  AMD. In order to bring both gas and dark matter to
                  the same footing, we smooth the angular momentum of
                  the particles over a fixed number of neighbors. The
                  AMDs obtained by this method have a smooth and
                  extended truncation as compared to earlier
                  methods. We find that an analytical function in
                  which the differential distribution of specific
                  angular momentum j is given by
                  P(j)=[1/jαdΓ(α)](j)α-1e-j/jd, where jd=jtot/α, can
                  be used to describe a wide variety of profiles, with
                  just one parameter α. The distribution of the shape
                  parameter α for both gas and dark matter follows
                  roughly a lognormal distribution.  The mean and
                  standard deviation of logα for gas are -0.04 and
                  0.11, respectively. About 90-95 percent of halos have
                  α<1.3, while exponential disks in
                  Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos would require
                  1.3<α<1.6.  This implies that a typical halo in
                  simulations has an excess of low angular momentum
                  material as compared to that of observed exponential
                  disks, a result that is consistent with the findings
                  of earlier works.  Parameter α for gas is correlated
                  with that for dark matter (DM), but they have a
                  significant scatter <αgas/αDM>=1.09+/-0.2. Parameter
                  αgas is also biased toward slightly higher values
                  compared to αDM.  The angular momentum in halos is
                  also found to have a significant spatial asymmetry
                  with the asymmetry being more pronounced for dark
                  matter.},

  journal =      {ArXiv e-prints},

  abstract =     {Elliptical galaxies contain X-ray emitting gas that
                  is subject to continuous ram pressure stripping over
                  timescales comparable to cluster ages. The gas in
                  these galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic
                  equilibrium.  Supernova feedback, stellar winds, or
                  active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can
                  significantly perturb the interstellar medium (ISM).
                  Using hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the
                  effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the
                  ram pressure stripping process in early-type
                  galaxies. We find that galaxies with the stronger
                  turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more
                  smoothly distributed tails of the stripped ISM than
                  those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence.  Our
                  main conclusion is that even very weak internal
                  turbulence, at the level of <15 percent of the average ISM
                  sound speed in a galaxy, can accelerate the gas
                  removal from the galaxy via ram pressure stripping
                  and remove a significant fraction (~50 percent) of the
                  preexisting ISM in ~6 Gyr. The magnitude of this
                  effect increases sharply with the strength of the
                  turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes place
                  near the boundary between the ISM and the
                  intraclustermedium (ICM), the boost in the ISM
                  stripping rate is due to the "random walk" of the
                  ISM from the central regions of the galactic
                  potential well to larger distances, where the ram
                  pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from
                  the galaxy. The ICM can be temporarily trapped
                  inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing
                  of the turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with
                  more turbulent ISM, yet still characterised by very
                  weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the
                  ICM. [Abridged]},

                  the dwarf spiral galaxy NGC 2976 in Hα and CO. The
                  high spatial (~75 pc) and spectral (13 and 2 km s-1,
                  respectively) resolution of these observations,
                  along with our multicolor optical and near-infrared
                  imaging, allows us to measure the shape of the
                  density profile of the dark matter halo with good
                  precision. We find that the total (baryonic plus
                  dark matter) mass distribution of NGC 2976 follows a
                  ρtot~r-0.27+/-0.09 power law out to a radius of 1.8
                  kpc, assuming that the observed radial motions
                  provide no support. The density profile attributed
                  to the dark halo is even shallower, consistent with
                  a nearly constant density of dark matter over the
                  entire observed region. A maximal disk fit yields an
                  upper limit to the K-band stellar mass-to-light
                  ratio (M*/LK) of 0.09+0.15-0.08Msolar/LsolarK
                  (including systematic uncertainties), with the
                  caveat that for M*/LK>0.19Msolar/LsolarK the dark
                  matter density increases with radius, which is
                  unphysical.  Assuming
                  0.10Msolar/LsolarK<~M*/LK<=0.19Msolar/LsolarK, the
                  dark matter density profile lies between ρDM~r-0.17
                  and ρDM~r-0.01. Therefore, independent of any
                  assumptions about the stellar disk or the functional
                  form of the density profile, NGC 2976 does not
                  contain a cuspy dark matter halo. We also
                  investigate some of the systematic effects that can
                  hamper rotation curve studies and show that (1)
                  long-slit rotation curves are far more vulnerable to
                  systematic errors than two-dimensional velocity
                  fields, (2) NGC 2976 contains radial motions that
                  are as large as 90 percent of the rotational velocities at
                  small radii, and (3) the Hα and CO velocity fields
                  of NGC 2976 agree within their uncertainties, with a
                  typical scatter between the two velocities of 5.3 km
                  s-1 at any position in the galaxy.  Based on

                  eight of the newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf
                  galaxies around the Milky Way. We measure the
                  velocity dispersions of Canes Venatici I, Canes
                  Venatici II, Coma Berenices, Hercules, Leo IV, Leo
                  T, Ursa Major I, and Ursa Major II from the
                  velocities of 18-214 stars in each galaxy and find
                  dispersions ranging from 3.3 to 7.6 km s-1. The six
                  galaxies with absolute magnitudes MV<-4 are highly
                  dark matter dominated, with mass-to-light ratios
                  approaching 1000 Msolar/Lsolar,V. For the fainter
                  galaxies we find tentative evidence for tidal
                  disruption. The measured velocity dispersions of the
                  ultra-faint dwarfs are correlated with their
                  luminosities, indicating that a minimum mass for
                  luminous galactic systems may not yet have been
                  reached. We also measure the metallicities of the
                  observed stars and find that the new dwarfs have
                  mean metallicities of [Fe/H]=-2.0 to -2.3 these
                  galaxies represent some of the most metal-poor
                  stellar systems known. The six brightest of the
                  ultra-faint dwarfs extend the luminosity-metallicity
                  relationship followed by more luminous dwarfs by a
                  factor of ~30 in luminosity. We detect metallicity
                  spreads of up to 0.5 dex in several objects,
                  suggesting multiple star formation epochs. UMa II
                  and Com, despite their exceptionally low
                  luminosities, have higher metallicities that suggest
                  they may once have been much more massive. Having
                  established the masses of the ultra-faint dwarfs, we
                  re-examine the missing satellite problem.  After
                  correcting for the sky coverage of the Sloan Digital
                  Sky Survey, we find that the ultra-faint dwarfs
                  substantially alleviate the discrepancy between the
                  predicted and observed numbers of satellites around

                  too few dwarf galaxies over a significant range of
                  masses. We show that if galaxy formation in low-mass
                  dark matter halos is strongly suppressed after
                  reionization, the simulated circular velocity
                  function of CDM subhalos can be brought into
                  approximate agreement with the observed circular
                  velocity function of Milky Way satellite galaxies.},

                  large-scale structure formation, and are responsible
                  for heating the intracluster medium in galaxy
                  clusters. In addition, they are capable of
                  accelerating non-thermal electrons and protons. In
                  this work, we focus on the acceleration of electrons
                  at shock fronts, which is thought to be responsible
                  for radio relics—extended radio features in the
                  vicinity of merging galaxy clusters. By combining
                  high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement/N-body
                  cosmological simulations with an accurate
                  shock-finding algorithm and a model for electron
                  acceleration, we calculate the expected synchrotron
                  emission resulting from cosmological structure
                  formation.  We produce synthetic radio maps of a
                  large sample of galaxy clusters and present
                  luminosity functions and scaling relationships. With
                  upcoming long-wavelength radio telescopes, we expect
                  to see an abundance of radio emission associated
                  with merger shocks in the intracluster medium. By
                  producing observationally motivated statistics, we
                  provide predictions that can be compared with

                  been well tested, and now the major challenge is to
                  build a large database of suitable observations of

                  of the dSph companions of our Galaxy, questions
                  concerning the ancient star formation histories of
                  nearby galaxies are stymied by a lack of suitably
                  deep imaging observations. The few observations
                  which do exist provide tantalizing evidence of

                  galaxies is developed and the rotation curve is
                  derived. At the center of the filament, in the plane
                  perpendicular to the long axis, the circular
                  velocity is constant for distances much less than
                  the filament length and Keplerian at much greater
                  distances. The filament rotation curve is equivalent
                  to that of the spherical truncated flat (TF)
                  profile, a model derived empirically to account for
                  the rapid decline of the radial velocity dispersion
                  of the Milky Way dark halo. For an isothermal,
                  self-gravitating filament with velocity anisotropy
                  parameter {\beta}, the rotation curve in the central
                  region varies as V_{c}\alpha r^{1-{\beta}/2},

                  isothermal filament of length 89 kpc can account for

                  Way dark halo with nearly three times less mass than
                  the NFW profile. The filament dimensions appear to

                  scenario on the clustering properties large-scale
                  structure in the Universe. We do this by extending
                  the halo model. The new development is that we
                  consider two components to the mass density: one
                  arising from mass in collapsed haloes, and the
                  second from a smooth component of uncollapsed
                  mass. Assuming that the nonlinear clustering of dark
                  matter haloes can be understood, then from
                  conservation arguments one can precisely calculate
                  the clustering properties of the smooth component
                  and its cross correlation with haloes. We then
                  explore how the three main ingredients of the halo
                  calculations, the halo mass function, bias and
                  density profiles are affected by warm dark matter
                  (WDM). We show that, relative to cold dark matter
                  (CDM), the halo mass function is suppressed by 50 percent,
                  for masses ˜100 times the free-streaming mass scale
                  Mfs. Consequently, the bias of low mass haloes can
                  be boosted by as much as ˜20 percent for 0.25 keV WDM
                  particles. Core densities of haloes will also be
                  suppressed relative to the CDM case. We also examine
                  the impact of relic thermal velocities on the
                  density profiles, and find that these effects are
                  constrained to scales r<1h-1kpc, and hence of little
                  importance for dark matter tests, owing to
                  uncertainties in the baryonic physics.  We use our
                  modified halo model to calculate the nonlinear
                  matter power spectrum, and find that there is
                  significant small-scale power in the model. However,
                  relative to the CDM case the power is suppressed.
                  The amount of suppression depends on the mass of the
                  WDM particle, but can be of order 10 percent at k˜1hMpc-1
                  for particles of mass 0.25 keV.  We then calculate
                  the expected signal and noise that our set of ΛWDM
                  models would give for a future weak lensing
                  mission. We show that the models should in principle
                  be separable at high significance.  Finally, using
                  the Fisher matrix formalism we forecast the limit on
                  the WDM particle mass for a future full-sky weak
                  lensing mission like Euclid or the Large Synoptic
                  Survey Telescope. With Planck priors and using only
                  multipoles l<5000, we find that a lower limit of 2.6
                  keV should be easily achievable.},

                  large-scale structure observations, and the
                  supernova luminosity/distance relationship.  Using
                  WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological
                  parameters for the power-law flat Λ cold dark matter
                  (ΛCDM) model are
                  (Ωmh2,Ωbh2,h,ns,τ,σ8)=(0.1277+0.0080-0.0079,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761+0.049-0.048).
                  The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed
                  volume in this six-dimensional parameter
                  space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are
                  adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data
                  alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index
                  that is significantly less than the
                  Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum
                  (ns=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves
                  the constraints on these components and the spectral
                  slope.  For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts
                  an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar
                  ratio, r0.002<0.65 (95 percent CL) and the combination of
                  WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey
                  implies r0.002<0.30 (95 percent CL). Models that suppress
                  large-scale power through a running spectral index
                  or a large-scale cutoff in the power spectrum are a
                  better fit to the WMAP and small-scale CMB data than
                  the power-law ΛCDM model; however, the improvement
                  in the fit to the WMAP data is only Δχ2=3 for 1
                  extra degree of freedom. Models with a
                  running-spectral index are consistent with a higher
                  amplitude of gravity waves. In a flat universe, the
                  combination of WMAP and the Supernova Legacy Survey
                  (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the
                  equation of state of the dark energy,
                  w=-0.967+0.073-0.072. If we assume w=-1, then the
                  deviations from the critical density, ΩK, are small:
                  the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies
                  Ωk=-0.011+/-0.012.  The combination of WMAP 3 year
                  data plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0
                  implies Ωk=-0.014+/-0.017 and ΩΛ=0.716+/-0.055. Even
                  if we do not include the prior that the universe is
                  flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale structure, and
                  supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint
                  on the dark energy equation of state,
                  w=-1.08+/-0.12.  For a flat universe, the
                  combination of WMAP and other astronomical data
                  yield a constraint on the sum of the neutrino
                  masses, Σmν<0.66 eV (95 percent CL). Consistent with the
                  predictions of simple inflationary theories, we
                  detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in
                  the CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the
                  bispectrum, trispectrum, and a new statistic

  abstract =     {This article introduces a family of analytical
                  functions of the form x ν K ν(x), where K ν is the
                  incomplete Bessel function of the third kind. This
                  family of functions can describe the density
                  profile, projected and integrated light profiles,
                  and the gravitational potentials of galaxies. For
                  the proper choice of parameters, these functions
                  accurately approximate Sérsic functions over a range
                  of indices and are good fits to galaxy light
                  profiles. With an additional parameter corresponding
                  to a galaxy core radius, these functions can fit
                  galaxy like M87 over a factor of 105 in
                  radius. Unlike Sérsic profiles, these functions have
                  simple analytical two-dimensional and
                  three-dimensional Fourier transforms, so they are
                  easily convolved with spatially varying point-spread
                  function (PSF) and are well suited for photometric
                  and lensing analysis. We use these functions to
                  estimate the effects of seeing on lensing
                  measurements and show that high S/N measurements,
                  even when the PSF is larger than the galaxy
                  effective radius, should be able to recover accurate
                  estimates of lensing distortions by weighting light
                  in the outer isophotes that are less affected by
                  seeing.},

  abstract =     {The cold dark matter model has become the leading
                  theoretical picture for the formation of structure
                  in the Universe. This model, together with the
                  theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction
                  for the initial conditions for structure formation
                  and predicts that structures grow hierarchically
                  through gravitational instability.  Testing this
                  model requires that the precise measurements
                  delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to
                  robust and equally precise theoretical
                  calculations. Here we present a simulation of the
                  growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603
                  particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to
                  the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion
                  lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also
                  follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies
                  and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in
                  the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected
                  in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy
                  distribution, an effect that can be used to
                  constrain the nature of dark energy with future
                  generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

                  simulation of a Milky Way sized dark matter halo,
                  and present the most comprehensive convergence study
                  for an individual dark matter halo carried out thus
                  far. We have also simulated a sample of six
                  ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes,
                  allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in
                  substructure statistics. In our largest simulation,
                  we resolve nearly 300000 gravitationally bound
                  subhaloes within the virialized region of the
                  halo. Simulations of the same object differing in
                  mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately
                  reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass,
                  maximum circular velocity and position, and yield
                  good convergence for the abundance and internal
                  properties of dark matter substructures. We detect
                  up to four generations of subhaloes within
                  subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find
                  less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo
                  when regions of equal mean overdensity are
                  compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is
                  much lower in subhaloes than in the main
                  halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass
                  spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass
                  fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent
                  within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within
                  the solar circle. The inner density profiles of
                  subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed
                  asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently
                  curving profiles of Einasto form.  The mean
                  concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately
                  described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down
                  to maximum circular velocities of 1.5kms-1, an
                  extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in
                  mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity,
                  subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes,
                  with a characteristic density that is typically ~2.6
                  times larger and increases with decreasing distance
                  from halo centre.},

  abstract =     {We discuss the cosmological simulation code
                  GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code,
                  capable of following a collisionless fluid with the
                  N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed
                  particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of
                  SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in
                  regions free of dissipation, while allowing for
                  fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational
                  forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole
                  expansion, which can optionally be applied in the
                  form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range
                  forces are computed with the `tree' method while
                  long-range forces are determined with Fourier
                  techniques. Time integration is based on a
                  quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and
                  short-range forces can be integrated with different
                  time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range
                  time-steps may also be employed. The domain
                  decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm
                  is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
                  flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend
                  on the way the domains are cut. The code is
                  efficient in terms of memory consumption and
                  required communication bandwidth.  It has been used
                  to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation
                  with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching
                  a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per
                  dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also
                  been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH
                  simulations that account for radiative cooling and
                  star formation, reaching total particle numbers of
                  more than 250 million. We present the algorithms
                  used by the code and discuss their accuracy and
                  performance using a number of test
                  problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the

                  star-forming gas on scales that are typically not
                  resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach
                  includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth
                  of cold clouds embedded in an ambient hot medium,
                  star formation in these clouds, feedback from
                  supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud
                  evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal
                  enrichment.  Implemented using smoothed particle
                  hydrodynamics, our scheme is a significantly
                  modified and extended version of the grid-based
                  method of Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a
                  high dynamic range in simulations of structure
                  formation.  We discuss properties of the feedback
                  model in detail and show that it predicts a
                  self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation,
                  which, in particular, stabilizes the star-forming
                  gaseous layers of disc galaxies. The parametrization
                  of this mode can be reduced to a single free
                  quantity that determines the overall time-scale for
                  star formation.  We fix this parameter numerically
                  to match the observed rates of star formation in
                  local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner,
                  cosmological simulations employing our model
                  nevertheless overproduce the observed cosmic
                  abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated
                  to extend our feedback model to include galactic
                  winds associated with star formation.  Using
                  small-scale simulations of individual star-forming
                  disc galaxies, we show that these winds produce
                  either galactic fountains or outflows, depending on
                  the depth of the gravitational potential. In
                  low-mass haloes, winds can greatly suppress the
                  overall efficiency of star formation. When
                  incorporated into cosmological simulations, our
                  combined model for star formation and winds predicts
                  a cosmic star formation density that is consistent
                  with observations, provided that the winds are
                  sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from
                  galaxies in these simulations drive chemical
                  enrichment of the intergalactic medium - in
                  principle, accounting for the presence of metals in

                  that of the Sun. Half of these galaxies were
                  discovered in the past few years in the Sloan
                  Digital Sky Survey, and they are among the least
                  luminous galaxies in the known Universe. A

                  a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales

                  could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation

  abstract =     {We study the effect that the dark matter background
                  (DMB) has on the gravitational energy content and,
                  in general, on the star formation efficiency of a
                  molecular cloud (MC). We first analyze the effect
                  that a dark matter halo, described by the Navarro et
                  al. (1996) density profile, has on the energy budget
                  of a spherical, homogeneous, cloud located at
                  different distances from the halo center. We found
                  that MCs located in the innermost regions of a
                  massive galaxy can feel a contraction force greater
                  than their self-gravity due to the incorporation of
                  the potential of the galaxy's dark matter halo. We
                  also calculated analytically the gravitational
                  perturbation that a MC produces over a uniform DMB
                  (uniform at the scales of a MC) and how this
                  perturbation will affect the evolution of the MC
                  itself. The study shows that the star formation in a
                  MC will be considerably enhanced if the cloud is
                  located in a dense and low velocity dark matter
                  environment. We confirm our results by measuring the
                  star formation efficiency in numerical simulations
                  of the formation and evolution of MCs within
                  different DMBs. Our study indicates that there are
                  situations where the dark matter's gravitational
                  contribution to the evolution of the molecular
                  clouds should not be neglected.},

                  cores, and explore the evolution of molecular
                  abundances in the contracting core. We model both
                  magnetic cores, with varying degrees of initial
                  magnetic support, and non-magnetic cores, with
                  varying collapse delay times. We explore, through a
                  parameter study, the competing effects of various
                  model parameters in the evolving molecular
                  abundances, including the elemental C/O ratio, the
                  temperature, and the cosmic-ray ionization rate. We
                  find that different models show their largest
                  quantitative differences at the center of the core,
                  whereas the outer layers, which evolve slower, have
                  abundances which are severely degenerate among
                  different dynamical models. There is a large range
                  of possible abundance values for different models at
                  a fixed evolutionary stage (central density), which
                  demonstrates the large potential of chemical
                  differentiation in prestellar cores.  However,
                  degeneracies among different models, compounded with
                  uncertainties induced by other model parameters,
                  make it difficult to discriminate among dynamical
                  models. To address these difficulties, we identify
                  abundance ratios between particular molecules, the
                  measurement of which would have maximal potential
                  for discrimination among the different models
                  examined here. In particular, we find that the
                  ratios between NH3 and CO; NH2 and CO; NH3 and HCO+
                  are sensitive to the evolutionary timescale, and
                  that the ratio between HCN and OH is sensitive to
                  the C/O ratio. Finally, we demonstrate that
                  measurements of the central deviation (central
                  depletion or enhancement) of abundances of certain
                  molecules are good indicators of the dynamics of the

  abstract =     {The balance of evidence indicates that individual
                  galaxies and groups or clusters of galaxies are
                  embedded in enormous distributions of cold, weakly
                  interacting dark matter. These dark matter 'halos'
                  provide the scaffolding for all luminous structure
                  in the universe, and their properties comprise an
                  essential part of the current cosmological model. I
                  review the internal properties of dark matter halos,
                  focussing on the simple, universal trends predicted
                  by numerical simulations of structure
                  formation. Simulations indicate that halos should
                  all have roughly the same spherically-averaged
                  density profile and kinematic structure, and predict
                  simple distributions of shape, formation history and
                  substructure in density and kinematics, over an
                  enormous range of halo mass and for all common
                  variants of the concordance cosmology.  I describe
                  observational progress towards testing these
                  predictions by measuring masses, shapes, profiles
                  and substructure in real halos, using baryonic
                  tracers or gravitational lensing. An important
                  property of simulated halos (possibly the most
                  important property) is their dynamical 'age', or
                  degree of internal relaxation. The age of a halo may
                  have almost as much effect as its mass in
                  determining the state of its baryonic contents, so
                  halo ages are also worth trying to measure
                  observationally. I review recent gravitational
                  lensing studies of galaxy clusters which should
                  measure substructure and relaxation in a large
                  sample of individual cluster halos, producing
                  quantitative measures of age that are well-matched
                  to theoretical predictions.  The age distributions
                  inferred from these studies will lead to
                  second-generation tests of the cosmological model,
                  as well as an improved understanding of cluster
                  assembly and the evolution of galaxies within
                  clusters.},

                  square degrees with mean redshift z~0.1. We employ a
                  matrix-based method using pseudo-Karhunen-Loève
                  eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance
                  measurements in 22 k-bands of both the clustering
                  power and its anisotropy due to redshift-space
                  distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window
                  functions in the range 0.02hMpc-1<k<0.3hMpc-1.  We
                  pay particular attention to modeling, quantifying,
                  and correcting for potential systematic errors,
                  nonlinear redshift distortions, and the artificial
                  red-tilt caused by luminosity-dependent bias.  Our
                  results are robust to omitting angular and radial
                  density fluctuations and are consistent between
                  different parts of the sky. Our final result is a
                  measurement of the real-space matter power spectrum
                  P(k) up to an unknown overall multiplicative bias
                  factor. Our calculations suggest that this bias
                  factor is independent of scale to better than a few
                  percent for k<0.1hMpc-1, thereby making our results

                  experiments such as the Wilkinson Microwave

                  not well-characterized by a single power law but
                  unambiguously shows curvature. As a simple
                  characterization of the data, our measurements are

                  rapid SF therein. As a consequence, SF is more
                  efficient by a factor of up to ~10 and is also
                  somewhat more extended, while the gas density
                  probability distribution function rapidly evolves
                  toward very high densities. We thus propose that the
                  actual mechanism of starburst triggering in galaxy
                  collisions can only be captured at high spatial
                  resolution and when the cooling of gas is modeled
                  down to less than 103 K. Not only does our model
                  reproduce the properties of the Antennae system, but
                  it also explains the "starburst mode" recently
                  revealed in high-redshift mergers compared to
                  quiescent disks.},

  abstract =     {The presence of a dark matter core in the central
                  kiloparsec of many dwarf galaxies has been a long
                  standing problem in galaxy formation theories based
                  on the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Recent
                  cosmological simulations, based on Smooth Particle
                  Hydrodynamics and rather strong feedback recipes
                  have shown that it was indeed possible to form
                  extended dark matter cores using baryonic processes
                  related to a more realistic treatment of the
                  interstellar medium.  Using adaptive mesh
                  refinement, together with a new, stronger supernovae
                  feedback scheme that we have recently implemented in
                  the RAMSES code, we show that it is also possible to
                  form a prominent dark matter core within the
                  well-controlled framework of an isolated, initially
                  cuspy, 10 billion solar masses dark matter
                  halo. Although our numerical experiment is
                  idealized, it allows a clean and unambiguous
                  identification of the dark matter core formation
                  process. Our dark matter inner profile is well
                  fitted by a pseudo-isothermal profile with a core
                  radius of 800 pc. The core formation mechanism is
                  consistent with the one proposed by Pontzen &
                  Governato (2012). We highlight two key observational
                  predictions of all simulations that find cusp-core
                  transformations: (i) a bursty star formation history
                  with peak to trough ratio of 5 to 10 and a duty
                  cycle comparable to the local dynamical time; and
                  (ii) a stellar distribution that is hot with
                  v/sigma=1. We compare the observational properties
                  of our model galaxy with recent measurements of the
                  isolated dwarf WLM. We show that the spatial and
                  kinematical distribution of stars and HI gas are in
                  striking agreement with observations, supporting the
                  fundamental role played by stellar feedback in
                  shaping both the stellar and dark matter
                  distribution.},

  abstract =     {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES,
                  is presented.  It has been designed to study
                  structure formation in the universe with high
                  spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive
                  Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based
                  data structure allowing recursive grid refinements
                  on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very
                  similar to the one developed for the ART code
                  \citep{kravtsov97}, with minor differences in the
                  exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is
                  based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern
                  shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately
                  the thermal history of the fluid component. The
                  accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using
                  various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to
                  cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy
                  used in cosmological simulations is described, and
                  potential spurious effects associated with shock
                  waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are
                  discussed and found to be negligible. Results
                  obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical
                  simulation of structure formation in a low density
                  Lambda CDM universe are reported, with 2563
                  particles and 4.1x 107 cells in the AMR grid,
                  reaching a formal resolution of 81923. A convergence
                  analysis of different quantities, such as dark
                  matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power
                  spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles,
                  shows that numerical results are converging down to
                  the actual resolution limit of the code, and are
                  well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in
                  the framework of the halo model.},

  abstract =     {Aims: The EROS-2 project was designed to test the
                  hypothesis that massive compact halo objects (the
                  so-called “machos”) could be a major component of
                  the dark matter halo of the Milky Way galaxy.  To
                  this end, EROS-2 monitored over 6.7 years 33×106
                  stars in the Magellanic clouds for microlensing
                  events caused by such objects.  Methods: In this
                  work, we use only a subsample of 7×106 bright stars
                  spread over 84 deg2 of the LMC and 9 deg2 of the
                  SMC. The strategy of using only bright stars helps
                  to discriminate against background events due to
                  variable stars and allows a simple determination of
                  the effects of source confusion (blending). The use
                  of a large solid angle makes the survey relatively
                  insensitive to effects that could make the optical
                  depth strongly direction dependent.  Results: Using
                  this sample of bright stars, only one candidate
                  event was found, whereas ~39 events would have been
                  expected if the Halo were entirely populated by
                  objects of mass M˜0.4~Msun. Combined with the
                  results of EROS-1, this implies that the optical
                  depth toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) due to
                  such lenses is τ<0.36×10-7 (95 percent CL), corresponding
                  to a fraction of the halo mass of less than 8 percent. This
                  optical depth is considerably less than that
                  measured by the MACHO collaboration in the central
                  region of the LMC. More generally, machos in the
                  mass range 0.6×10-7M_sun<M<15~Msun are ruled out as
                  the primary occupants of the Milky Way Halo.  Based
                  on observations made with the Marly telescope at the

  abstract =     {We examine scaling relations of dispersion-supported
                  galaxies over more than eight orders of magnitude in
                  luminosity by transforming standard fundamental
                  plane parameters into a space of mass, radius, and
                  luminosity. The radius variable r 1/2 is the
                  deprojected (three-dimensional) half-light radius,
                  the mass variable M 1/2 is the total gravitating
                  mass within this radius, and L 1/2 is half the
                  luminosity. We find that from ultra-faint dwarf
                  spheroidals to giant cluster spheroids,
                  dispersion-supported galaxies scatter about a
                  one-dimensional "fundamental curve" through this MRL
                  space. The mass-radius-luminosity relation
                  transitions from M 1/2 ~ r 1.44 1/2 ~ L 0.30 1/2 for
                  the faintest dwarf spheroidal galaxies to M 1/2 ~ r
                  1.42 1/2 ~ L 3.2 1/2 for the most luminous galaxy
                  cluster spheroids. The weakness of the M 1/2 - L 1/2
                  slope on the faint end may imply that potential well
                  depth limits galaxy formation in small galaxies,
                  while the stronger dependence on L 1/2 on the bright
                  end suggests that baryonic physics limits galaxy
                  formation in massive galaxies. The mass-radius
                  projection of this curve can be compared to median
                  dark matter halo mass profiles of ΛCDM halos in
                  order to construct a virial mass-luminosity
                  relationship (M vir-L) for galaxies that spans seven
                  orders of magnitude in M vir. Independent of any
                  global abundance or clustering information, we find
                  that (spheroidal) galaxy formation needs to be most
                  efficient in halos of M vir ~ 1012 M sun and to
                  become inefficient above and below this
                  scale. Moreover, this profile matching technique for
                  deriving the M vir-L is most accurate at the high-
                  and low-luminosity extremes (where dark matter
                  fractions are highest) and is therefore quite
                  complementary to statistical approaches that rely on
                  having a well-sampled luminosity function. We also
                  consider the significance and utility of the scatter
                  about this relation, and find that in the dSph
                  regime observational errors are almost at the point
                  where we can explore the intrinsic scatter in the
                  luminosity-virial mass relation. Finally, we note
                  that purely stellar systems such as globular
                  clusters and ultra-compact dwarfs do not follow the
                  fundamental curve relation.  This allows them to be
                  easily distinguished from dark-matter-dominated dSph
                  galaxies in MRL space.},

                  matter (DM) content of early-type galaxies and their
                  sizes and ages, using a sample of
                  intermediate-redshift (z ~ 0.2) gravitational lenses
                  from the SLACS survey, and by comparing them to a
                  larger sample of z ~ 0 galaxies.  We decompose the
                  deprojected galaxy masses into DM and stellar
                  components using combinations of strong lensing,
                  stellar dynamics, and stellar populations
                  modeling. For a given stellar mass, we find that for
                  galaxies with larger sizes, the DM fraction
                  increases and the mean DM density decreases,
                  consistently with the cuspy halos expected in
                  cosmological formation scenarios. The DM fraction
                  also decreases with stellar age, which can be
                  partially explained by the inverse correlation
                  between size and age. The residual trend may point
                  to systematic dependencies on formation epoch of
                  halo contraction or stellar initial mass
                  functions. These results are in agreement with
                  recent findings based on local galaxies by
                  Napolitano et al. and suggest negligible evidence of
                  galaxy evolution over the last ~2.5 Gyr other than

                  defined by an arbitrary density threshold, 200 ≤ δ*
                  ≤ 1600, and that provides accurate predictions from
                  low-mass to high-mass halos.  Methods: We point out
                  that it is possible to build simple and efficient
                  models, with no free parameter for the halo bias, by
                  using integral constraints that govern the behavior
                  of low-mass and typical halos, whereas the
                  properties of rare massive halos are derived through
                  explicit asymptotic approaches. We also describe how
                  to take into account the impact of halo motions on
                  their bias, using their linear displacement field.
                  Results: We obtain a good agreement with numerical
                  simulations for the halo mass functions and
                  large-scale bias at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 2.5, for halos
                  defined by a nonlinear density threshold 200 ≤ δ* ≤
                  1600. We also evaluate the impact on the halo bias
                  of two common approximations, i) neglecting halo
                  motions, and ii) linearizing the halo two-point

                  angular momentum distributions of dark matter and
                  nonradiative gas in a large sample of halos. We show
                  that the two components have identical spin
                  parameter distributions and that their angular
                  momentum distributions within individual halos are
                  very similar, all in excellent agreement with
                  standard assumptions.  Despite these similarities,
                  however, we find that the angular momentum vectors
                  of the gas and dark matter are poorly aligned, with
                  a median misalignment angle of ~30°, which might
                  have important implications for spin correlation
                  statistics used in weak lensing studies. We present
                  distributions for the component of the angular
                  momentum that is aligned with the total angular
                  momentum of each halo and find that for between 5 percent
                  and 50 percent  of the mass, this component is negative.
                  This disagrees with the generally adopted
                  ``universal'' angular momentum distribution, for
                  which the mass fraction with negative specific
                  angular momentum is zero. We discuss the
                  implications of our results for the formation of
                  disk galaxies. Since galactic disks generally do not
                  contain counterrotating stars or gas, disk formation
                  cannot occur under detailed conservation of specific
                  angular momentum. We suggest that the material with
                  negative specific angular momentum combines with
                  positive angular momentum material to build a bulge
                  component, and we show that in such a scenario the
                  remaining material can form a disk with a density
                  distribution that is very close to exponential.},

                  accretion are obtained from a standard merger
                  tree. During the subsequent evolution, the subhaloes
                  experience mass loss due to the combined effect of
                  dynamical friction, tidal stripping, and tidal
                  heating.  Rather than integrating these effects
                  along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the
                  average mass-loss rate, where the average is taken
                  over all possible orbital configurations. Under the
                  Ansatz that the average distribution of orbits is
                  independent of parent halo mass, this allows us to
                  write the average mass-loss rate as a simple

                  halo. After calibrating this model by matching the
                  subhalo mass function (SHMF) of cluster-sized dark
                  matter haloes obtained from high-resolution,
                  numerical simulations, we investigate the predicted
                  mass and redshift dependence of the SHMF. We find
                  that, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass
                  function is not universal.  Instead, both the slope
                  and the normalization depend on the ratio of the
                  parent halo mass, M, and the characteristic
                  non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a halo
                  formation time dependence; more massive parent
                  haloes form later, thus allowing less time for mass
                  loss to operate. We predict that galaxy-sized
                  haloes, with a present-day mass of M~=
                  1012h-1Msolar, have an average mass fraction of dark
                  matter subhaloes that is a factor of 3 lower than
                  for massive clusters with M~= 1015h-1Msolar. We also
                  analyse the halo-to-halo scatter in SHMFs, and show
                  that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes
                  depends most strongly on their accretion history in
                  the last ~1Gyr.  Finally we provide a simple fitting
                  function for the average SHMF of a parent halo of
                  any mass at any redshift and for any cosmology, and

  abstract =     {A flat distribution of low gas entropy in the core
                  region of galaxy clusters is a feature commonly
                  found in Eulerian cosmological simulations, at
                  variance with most standard simulations of smoothed
                  particle hydrodynamics fashion. From the literature,
                  it is still unclear whether this difference is
                  entirely due to numerical artefacts (e.g. spurious
                  transfer from gravitational energy to thermal
                  energy), physical mechanisms (e.g.  enhanced mixing
                  in Eulerian codes) or a mixture of both. This issue
                  is related to many still open lines of research in
                  the characterization of the dynamical evolution of
                  the baryons in galaxy clusters: the origin of the
                  cool-core/non-cool-core bi-modality, the diffusion
                  of metals within galaxy clusters, the interplay
                  between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the
                  intra-cluster medium, etc.  In this work, we aim at
                  constraining to what extent the entropy core is
                  affected by numerical effects, and which are the
                  physical reasons for its production in cosmological
                  runs. To this end, we run a set of 30
                  high-resolution re-simulations of a ˜3 × 1014 Msun
                  h-1 cluster of galaxies with a quiet dynamical
                  history, using modified versions of the cosmological
                  adaptive mesh refinement code ENZO and investigating
                  many possible (physical and numerical) details
                  involved in the production of entropy in simulated
                  galaxy clusters.  We report that the occurrence of a
                  flat entropy core in the innermost region of a
                  massive cluster is mainly due to hydrodynamical
                  processes resolved by the numerical code
                  (e.g. shocks and mixing motions) and that additional
                  spurious effects of numerical origin
                  (e.g. artificial heating due to softening effects)
                  affect the size and level of the entropy core only
                  in a minor way.  Using Lagrangian tracers we show
                  that the entropy profile of non-radiative
                  simulations is produced by a mechanism of `sorting
                  in entropy' which takes place with regularity during
                  the cluster evolution. The evolution of tracers
                  illustrates that the flat entropy core is caused by
                  physical mixing of subsonic motions (mostly driven
                  by accreted sub-clumps) within the shallow inner
                  cluster potential.  Several re-simulations were also
                  produced for the same cluster object with the
                  addition of radiative cooling, uniform pre-heating
                  at high redshift (z= 10) and late (z < 1) thermal
                  energy feedback from AGN activity in the cluster, in
                  order to assess the effects of such mechanisms on
                  the final entropy profile of the cluster. We report
                  on the infeasibility of balancing the catastrophic
                  cooling (and recovering a flat entropy profile) by
                  means of the investigated trials for AGN activity
                  alone, while for a sub-set of pre-heating models, or
                  AGN feedback plus pre-heating models, a flat entropy
                  distribution similar to non-radiative runs can be
                  obtained with a viable energy
                  requirement. Complementary analysis is presented
                  also for a major merger cluster, obtaining similar
                  results and achieving a generally good consistency
                  with X-ray data for the entropy distribution in real
                  galaxy clusters.},

                  simulations done in combination with a semi-analytic
                  galaxy formation model. Our goal is to establish
                  whether the subhalos present in LCDM simulations of
                  Milky Way-like systems could host the dwarf
                  spheroidal (dSph) satellites of our Galaxy. Our
                  analysis shows that, contrary to what has been
                  assumed in most previous work, the mass profiles of
                  subhalos are generally not well fit by NFW models
                  but that Einasto profiles are preferred.  We find
                  that for shape parameters alpha = 0.2 - 0.5 and Vmax
                  = 10 - 30 km/s there is very good correspondance
                  with the observational constraints obtained for the
                  nine brightest dSph of the Milky Way.  Furthermore,
                  the internal dynamics of these systems, as well as
                  the number of objects of a given circular velocity
                  are also matched if the total mass of the Milky Way
                  is ~8x10^11 Msun, a value that is in agreement with
                  many recent determinations. Our simulations show
                  important scatter in the number of bright
                  satellites, even when the Aquarius Milky Way-like
                  hosts are scaled to a common mass, and we find no
                  evidence for a missing population of massive
                  subhalos in the Galaxy. This conclusion is also
                  supported when we examine the dynamics of the
                  satellites of M31.},

                  evolution from self-similar, spherically symmetric
                  linear perturbations of a cold dark matter
                  (CDM)-dominated Einstein-de Sitter universe. As a
                  result of the radial orbit instability, the haloes
                  which grow from such initial conditions are triaxial
                  with major-to-minor axial ratios of the order of
                  3:1. They nevertheless grow approximately
                  self-similarly in time. In all cases, they have
                  power-law density profiles and near-constant
                  velocity anisotropy in their inner regions. Both the
                  power-law index and the value of the velocity
                  anisotropy depend on the similarity index of the
                  initial conditions, the former as expected from
                  simple scaling arguments. Halo structure is thus not
                  'universal' but remembers the initial conditions. On
                  larger scales the density and anisotropy profiles
                  show two characteristic scales, corresponding to
                  particles at the first pericentre and at the first
                  apocentre after infall.  They are well approximated
                  by the Navarro-Frenk-White model only for one value
                  of the similarity index. In contrast, at all radii
                  within the outer caustic the pseudo-phase-space
                  density can be fitted by a single power law with an
                  index which depends only very weakly on the
                  similarity index of the initial conditions. This
                  behaviour is very similar to that found for haloes
                  formed from ΛCDM initial conditions and so can be
                  considered approximately universal.},

                  measurements of each star's line-of-sight velocity
                  (median error ±2.1 km s-1) and spectral line indices
                  for iron and magnesium absorption features.  We use
                  globular cluster spectra to calibrate the indices
                  onto standard [Fe/H] metallicity scales, but
                  comparison of the resulting metallicities with
                  published values suggests that the MMFS indices are
                  best used as indicators of relative, not absolute,
                  metallicity. The empirical distributions of velocity
                  and spectral indices also allow us to quantify the
                  amount of contamination by foreground stars. In a
                  companion paper, we develop an algorithm that
                  evaluates the membership probability for each star,
                  showing that the present MMFS sample contains more
                  than 5000 dSph members, including 774 Carina
                  members, 2483 Fornax members, 1365 Sculptor members,
                  and 441 Sextans members.  This paper presents data

  abstract =     {We apply the Jeans equation to estimate masses for
                  eight of the brightest dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
                  galaxies. For Fornax, the dSph with the largest
                  kinematic data set, we obtain a model-independent
                  constraint on the maximum circular velocity, V max =
                  20+4 -3 km s-1. Although we obtain only lower limits
                  of V max >~ 10 km s-1 for the remaining dSphs, we
                  find that in all cases the enclosed mass at the
                  projected half-light radius is well constrained and
                  robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity
                  anisotropies. We derive a simple analytic formula
                  that estimates M(r half) accurately with respect to
                  results from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this
                  formula to the entire population of Local Group
                  dSphs with published kinematic data, we demonstrate
                  a correlation such that M(r half) vprop r 1.4±0.4
                  half, or in terms of the mean density interior to
                  the half-light radius, langρrang vprop r -1.6±0.4
                  half. This relation is driven by the fact that the
                  dSph data exhibit a correlation between global
                  velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue
                  that tidal forces are unlikely to have introduced
                  this relation, but tides may have increased the
                  scatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are
                  well described by mass profiles ranging over a
                  factor of lsim2 in normalization (V max ~ 10-20 km
                  s-1), we consider the hypothesis that all dSphs are
                  embedded within a "universal" dark matter halo. We
                  show that in addition to the power law M vprop r
                  1.4, viable candidates include a cuspy
                  "Navarro-Frenk-White" halo with V max ~ 15 km s-1
                  and scale radius r 0 ~ 800 pc, as well as a cored
                  halo with V max ~ 13 km s-1 and r 0 ~ 150
                  pc. Finally, assuming that their measured velocity
                  dispersions accurately reflect their masses, the
                  smallest dSphs now allow us to resolve dSph
                  densities at radii as small as a few tens of pc. At
                  these small scales, we find mean densities as large
                  as langρrang <~ 5 M sun pc-3 (lsim200 GeV cm-3).

                  mass profiles within dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
                  galaxies directly from stellar spectroscopic data
                  and without adopting a dark matter halo model. Our
                  method combines two recent results: (1) spherically
                  symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models imply that the
                  product of half-light radius and (squared) stellar
                  velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the mass
                  enclosed within the half-light radius of a dSph
                  stellar component, and (2) some dSphs have
                  chemodynamically distinct stellar subcomponents that
                  independently trace the same gravitational
                  potential. We devise a statistical method that uses
                  measurements of stellar positions, velocities, and
                  spectral indices to distinguish two dSph stellar
                  subcomponents and to estimate their individual
                  half-light radii and velocity dispersions.  For a
                  dSph with two detected stellar subcomponents, we
                  obtain estimates of masses enclosed at two discrete
                  points in the same mass profile, immediately
                  defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic
                  data, our method distinguishes stellar subcomponents
                  in the Fornax and Sculptor dSphs, for which we
                  measure slopes Γ ≡ Δlog M/Δlog r = 2.61+0.43 -0.37
                  and Γ = 2.95+0.51 -0.39, respectively. These values
                  are consistent with "cores" of constant density
                  within the central few hundred parsecs of each
                  galaxy and rule out "cuspy" Navarro-Frenk-White
                  (NFW) profiles (dlog M/dlog r <= 2 at all radii)
                  with a significance >~ 96 percent and >~ 99 percent,
                  respectively. Tests with synthetic data indicate
                  that our method tends systematically to overestimate
                  the mass of the inner stellar subcomponent to a
                  greater degree than that of the outer stellar
                  subcomponent, and therefore to underestimate the
                  slope Γ (implying that the stated NFW exclusion
                  levels are conservative).},

                  following four types of alignment signals: (1) the
                  alignment between the distributions of the
                  satellites of each group relative to the direction
                  of the nearest neighbor group (NNG); (2) the
                  alignment between the major axis direction of the
                  central galaxy of the host group (HG) and the
                  direction of the NNG; (3) the alignment between the
                  major axes of the central galaxies of the HG and the
                  NNG; and (4) the alignment between the major axes of
                  the satellites of the HG and the direction of the
                  NNG. We find strong signal of alignment between the
                  satellite distribution and the orientation of
                  central galaxy relative to the direction of the NNG,
                  even when the NNG is located beyond 3r vir of the
                  host group.  The major axis of the central galaxy of
                  the HG is aligned with the direction of the NNG. The
                  alignment signals are more prominent for groups that
                  are more massive and with early-type central
                  galaxies.  We also find that there is a preference
                  for the two major axes of the central galaxies of
                  the HG and NNG to be parallel for the system with
                  both early central galaxies, however, not for the
                  systems with both late-type central galaxies. For
                  the orientation of satellite galaxies, we do not
                  find any significant alignment signals relative to
                  the direction of the NNG. From these four types of
                  alignment measurements, we conclude that the
                  large-scale environment traced by the nearby group
                  affects primarily the shape of the host dark matter
                  halo, and hence also affects the distribution of
                  satellite galaxies and the orientation of central
                  galaxies. In addition, the NNG directly affects the
                  distribution of the satellite galaxies by inducing
                  asymmetric alignment signals, and the NNG at very
                  small separation may also contribute a second-order
                  impact on the orientation of the central galaxy in
                  the HG.},

                  galaxies at this redshift range: the red and blue
                  classes correspond to the early and late
                  morphological types, respectively, and the
                  early-type satellites are on average brighter than

                  study the correlations among different halo
                  properties (assembly time, spin, shape and
                  substructure), and how these halo properties are
                  correlated with the large-scale environment in which
                  haloes reside. The large-scale tidal field estimated
                  from haloes above a mass threshold is used as our
                  primary quantity to characterize the large-scale
                  environment, while other parameters, such as the
                  local overdensity and the morphology of large-scale
                  structure, are used for comparison. For haloes at a
                  fixed mass, all the halo properties depend
                  significantly on environment, particularly the tidal
                  field. The environmental dependence of halo assembly
                  time is primarily driven by local tidal field. The
                  mass of the unbound fraction in substructure is
                  boosted in strong tidal force region, while the
                  bound fraction is suppressed. Haloes have a tendency
                  to spin faster in a stronger tidal field and the
                  trend is stronger for more massive haloes. The spin
                  vectors show significant alignment with the
                  intermediate axis of the tidal field, as expected
                  from the tidal torque theory.  Both the major and
                  minor axes of haloes are strongly aligned with the
                  corresponding principal axes of the tidal field. In
                  general, a halo that can accrete more material after
                  the formation of its main halo on average is
                  younger, more elongated, spins faster and contains a
                  larger amount of substructure. Higher-density
                  environments not only provide more material for
                  haloes to accrete, but also are places of stronger
                  tidal fields that tend to suppress halo accretion.
                  The environmental dependencies are the results of
                  these two competing effects. The tidal field based
                  on haloes can be estimated from observation, and we
                  discuss the implications of our results for the
                  environmental dependence of galaxy properties.},

                  imprint of assembly history on the structure of
                  Galaxy-mass cold dark matter haloes.  Our results
                  confirm earlier work regarding the influence of
                  mergers on the mass density profile and the
                  inside-out growth of haloes.  The inner regions that
                  contain the visible galaxies are stable since early
                  times and are significantly affected only by major
                  mergers.  Particles accreted diffusely or in minor
                  mergers are found predominantly in the outskirts of
                  haloes. Our analysis reveals trends that run counter
                  to current perceptions of hierarchical halo
                  assembly. For example, major mergers (i.e. those
                  with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)
                  contribute little to the total mass growth of a
                  halo, on average less than 20 per cent for our six
                  Aquarius haloes. The bulk is contributed roughly
                  equally by minor mergers and by ‘diffuse’ material
                  which is not resolved into individual objects. This
                  is consistent with modelling based on excursion-set
                  theory which suggests that about half of this
                  diffuse material should not be part of a halo of any
                  scale. The simulations themselves suggest that a
                  significant fraction is not truly diffuse, since it
                  was ejected from earlier haloes by mergers prior to
                  their joining the main system. The Aquarius
                  simulations resolve haloes to much lower mass scales
                  than are expected to retain gas or form stars. Thus,
                  the fraction of diffuse dark matter accreted by
                  haloes represents a lower limit to the fraction of
                  diffuse baryons accreted by galaxies. Our results
                  thus confirm that most of the baryons from which
                  visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather
                  than through mergers, and they suggest that only
                  relatively rare major mergers will affect galaxy
                  structure at later times.},

                  Globular Clusters in M87}},
  journal =      {ArXiv e-prints},
  year =         2012,
  month =        jan,
  abstract =     {Globular clusters have linear sizes (tidal radii)
                  which theory tells us are determined by their masses
                  and by the gravitational potential of their host
                  galaxy. To explore the relationship between observed
                  and expected radii, we utilize the globular cluster
                  population of the Virgo giant M87. Unusually deep,
                  high signal-to-noise images of M87 are used to
                  measure the effective and limiting radii of
                  approximately 2000 globular clusters. To compare
                  with these observations, we simulate a globular
                  cluster population that has the same characteristics
                  as the observed M87 cluster population. Placing
                  these simulated clusters in the well-studied tidal
                  field of M87, the orbit of each cluster is solved
                  and the theoretical tidal radius of each cluster is
                  determined.  We compare the predicted relationship
                  between cluster size and projected galactocentric
                  distance to observations. We find that for an
                  isotropic distribution of cluster velocities,
                  theoretical tidal radii are approximately equal to
                  observed limiting radii for Rgc < 10 kpc. However,
                  the isotropic simulation predicts a steep increase
                  in cluster size at larger radii, which is not
                  observed in large galaxies beyond the Milky Way. To
                  minimize the discrepancy between theory and
                  observations, we explore the effects of orbital
                  anisotropy on cluster sizes, and suggest a possible
                  orbital anisotropy profile for M87 which yields a
                  better match between theory and
                  observations. Finally, we suggest future studies
                  which will establish a stronger link between
                  theoretical tidal radii and observed radii.},

                  dissipation plays a role along with purely
                  gravitational processes. The gist of the model is
                  that the distribution of the dominant mass component
                  on all scales arises from purely gravitational
                  clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity
                  functions of galaxies are determined by
                  gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model
                  accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark
                  matter', apparently making up about 80 percent or more of
                  the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which
                  may constitute massive halos around large
                  galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar
                  gravitational clustering in an expanding
                  universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical
                  fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge
                  into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated
                  in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the
                  resulting potential wells cools and acquires
                  sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming
                  luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit
                  agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and
                  radii of large galaxies.  On certain specific
                  assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that
                  agrees reasonably well with observation.},

                  cluster system. Clusters more metal-poor than (Fe/H)
                  = -0.8 constitute the familiar halo population,
                  while clusters more metal-rich than (Fe/H) = -0.8
                  have the properties of a disk system. There is a

                  kinematic analysis of a sample of globular clusters
                  under different relaxation conditions, based on
                  their core relaxation time (as listed in available
                  catalogs), by means of two well-known families of
                  spherical stellar dynamical models. Systems
                  characterized by shorter relaxation time scales are
                  expected to be better described by isotropic King
                  models, while less relaxed systems might be
                  interpreted by means of non-truncated,
                  radially-biased anisotropic f^(\nu) models,
                  originally designed to represent stellar systems
                  produced by a violent relaxation formation process
                  and applied here for the first time to the study of
                  globular clusters. The comparison between dynamical
                  models and observations is performed by fitting
                  simultaneously surface brightness and velocity
                  dispersion profiles.  For each globular cluster, the
                  best-fit model in each family is identified, along
                  with a full error analysis on the relevant
                  parameters. Detailed structural properties and
                  mass-to-light ratios are also explicitly derived. We
                  find that King models usually offer a good
                  representation of the observed photometric profiles,
                  but often lead to less satisfactory fits to the
                  kinematic profiles, independently of the relaxation
                  condition of the systems. For some less relaxed
                  clusters, f^(\nu) models provide a good description
                  of both observed profiles. Some derived structural
                  characteristics, such as the total mass or the
                  half-mass radius, turn out to be significantly
                  model-dependent. The analysis confirms that, to
                  answer some important dynamical questions that bear
                  on the formation and evolution of globular clusters,
                  it would be highly desirable to acquire larger
                  numbers of accurate kinematic data-points, well
                  distributed over the cluster field.},

                  information about dark matter halos; however, their
                  results are largely empirical. Using analytic means,
                  we attempt to shed light on simulation results by
                  generalizing the self-similar secondary infall model
                  to include tidal torque. In this first of two
                  papers, we describe our halo formation model and
                  compare our results to empirical mass profiles
                  inspired by N-body simulations. Each halo is
                  determined by four parameters.  One parameter sets
                  the mass scale and the other three define how
                  particles within a mass shell are torqued throughout
                  evolution. We choose torque parameters motivated by
                  tidal torque theory and N-body simulations and
                  analytically calculate the structure of the halo in
                  different radial regimes. We find that angular
                  momentum plays an important role in determining the
                  density profile at small radii.  For cosmological
                  initial conditions, the density profile on small
                  scales is set by the time rate of change of the
                  angular momentum of particles as well as the halo
                  mass. On intermediate scales, however, ρ∝r-2, while

  abstract =     {Using a generalized self-similar secondary infall
                  model, which accounts for tidal torques acting on
                  the halo, we analyze the velocity profiles of halos
                  in order to gain intuition for N-body simulation
                  results.  We analytically calculate the asymptotic
                  behavior of the internal radial and tangential
                  kinetic energy profiles in different radial
                  regimes. We then numerically compute the velocity
                  anisotropy and pseudo-phase-space density profiles
                  and compare them to recent N-body simulations. For
                  cosmological initial conditions, we find both
                  numerically and analytically that the anisotropy
                  profile asymptotes at small radii to a constant set
                  by model parameters. It rises on intermediate scales
                  as the velocity dispersion becomes more radially
                  dominated and then drops off at radii larger than
                  the virial radius where the radial velocity
                  dispersion vanishes in our model. The
                  pseudo-phase-space density is universal on
                  intermediate and large scales. However, its
                  asymptotic slope on small scales depends on the halo
                  mass and on how mass shells are torqued after
                  turnaround. The results largely confirm N-body
                  simulations but show some differences that are
                  likely due to our assumption of a one-dimensional
                  phase space manifold.},
