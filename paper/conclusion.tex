\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The new non-parametric method samples the profiles of the overall
density bin-wise, and was shown to reconstruct the density of diverse
mock data.

\TODO{better agreement with cusp or with core? what does that tell us?}

The number of bins has to be chosen such that the numerical errors
introduced from integrating finite datapoints do not contribute
significantly to $\chi^2$. Especially the projection of the 3D model
density profiles for the tracer densities onto the 2D plane of the sky
introduced was erroneous when done with $N_{bin}\leq7$. Spacing the
bins logarithmically instead of setting equal number of tracers per
bin helps to circumvent this problem, as does increasing the number of
bins. With both approaches, the integral \TODO{ref.} includes more of
the high density region in the center.
