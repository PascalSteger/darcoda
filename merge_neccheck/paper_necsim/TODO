Procedure until completion of MSc thesis on Friday, March 11, 2010
Dark Matter in Dwarf Galaxies
==================================================================

Scientific goals
================
[ ] exact definition/naming of overdensity peaks
[ ] DM density around biggest substructures
[ ] baryon density inside substructures near biggest substructures
[ ] Einasto profile fitting

Coding goals
============
[ ] file management:
  [x] scientific data on teutates
  [ ] analysis output on brutus:/~
  [x] organizational stuff on snowball
[ ] format of sod output
[x] zoom-in amr (higher level)
[x] zoom-in DM density (with sod/octreef positions)


to be checked
=============
[x] coincidence sod positions/octreef positions

problems
========


dsph article
============
[ ] introduction
  [ ] articles from reading list
  [ ] include short intro from reading list email
[ ] data description
  [ ] simulation properties in table
[ ] pipeline description
[ ] radial dependence of AMR density

Figures
=======
[x] DM density around 5 most massive substructures

possible errors in pipeline
