\section{Method}\label{sec:method}
We employ the non-parametric mass modelling described in
\TODO{citep{Steger+2014}}:

The total mass density is given in bins by setting the density slope

\begin{equation}
n(r_j)=-{\rm d}\ln\rho(r)/{\rm d}\ln r|_{r=r_j}
\end{equation}
for $j ... N_{\rm bin}$ radial bins: $1\leq j\leq N_{\rm bin}$, and
interpolated linearly in between bin radii $r_{{\rm min},j}<r<r_{{\rm
    max},j}$.

The density then is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(r) = \rho_{1/2}\cdot\exp\left[-\int_{\ln r_{1/2}}^{\ln r}n(s)\text{d}s\right],
\end{equation*}
with the density at half-light radius $\rho(r_{1/2})=\rho_{1/2}$, We
prescribe three buffer bins $n(r_j)$ for $j\in\{N_{\rm bin}+1,
N_{\rm bin}+2, N_{\rm bin}+3\}$ outside of the range where data is given to
enable sensible extrapolations towards high radii, and two additional slopes
$n_0 < 3, n_\infty>3$ for the asymptotic density slopes towards $r=0$ and
$r=\infty$, which are reached at half the smallest radius and $r_\infty=10r_{\rm
  max}$.


\subsection{Splitting Populations}\label{sec:metals}
Observations of the abundances of metals and chemical species in the
stellar atmospheres show that the ensemble of stars in a dwarf galaxy
or globular cluster can be split into populations.

An approach by \cite{WalkerPenarrubia2011} showed that if the
population of Fornax is split into two populations based on Magnesium
index and positions and LOS velocities assuming a Plummer sphere, and
each of their half-light radius and mass inside that radius are
determined, restrictions on the overall potential can be drawn. Using
this approach, they prefer a cored DM profile for Fornax.

For our data, we will use a splitting based on Magnesium index alone. This is
achieved by using a separate Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The
overall Magnesium index distribution is represented by a sum of two
Gaussians with means $\mu_{1,2}$ and widths $\sigma_{1,2}$, and each
stellar tracer with Mg index $M$ is assigned a population based on
the likelihood of its metallicity belonging to said population. The
process is repeated to marginalize over the means and widths of the
metallicity distributions. A sample splitting result is shown in
fig. ~\ref{fig:pymcmetal}.

        \caption{Reconstruction of two populations from mock data. The
          underlying metallicity distributions are shown as red and
          blue histograms. The retrieved centers of the Gaussians are
          shown as vertical lines, and the reconstructed metallicity
          distribution is depicted as black line.}
        \label{fig:pymcmetal}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We restrict the method to Mg indices only, as the iron measurements in
\cite{WalkerPenarrubia2011} are not reliable enough, and a sizeable
fraction has no metallicity measurements.

\cite{WalkerPenarrubia2011} assume a Plummer-like profile for both
populations, which must be dropped in our non-parametric profile. We
additionally let drop the velocity information, and concentrate on
non-kinematic properties of the stars only. Foreground stars are
accounted for by weighting the probabilities of membership in each
population with the overall dSph probability of membership.

We first assume two populations, and from the pdf of the Mg indices,
we calculate the tracer density profiles for both populations. Each
star contributes to both populations, with a fraction given by its
probability of belonging to the chemical population $i$.

If we then see no significant difference between the half-light radii
distribution of all models with two populations, we conclude that
population splitting for that particular galaxy will not give us a
significant information gain in \GravImage\ .

If we on the other hand get a distinct peak in the pdf of the
half-light radii we know that there are two -- or possibly more --
distinct populations we can use for further analysis.

Optimally, we assign each star randomly in proportion to $f_i$ to
population $i$ for each step in the MultiNest procedure.


\subsection{Detailed Explanation}
In our test suite there are dwarf galaxies with different scale radii
and small differences in the mean of the metallicity for the two
populations of stars. In order to reproduce the underlying populations
we use an inset MCMC with assumptions that

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foreground stars are younger than most of the dSph member
  stars. Therefore, they show a high metallicity and can be removed
  from the dataset with a single cut in metallicity;
\item the remaining stellar components are divided into two
  populations;
\item the fraction of stars in population 1 is sampled in a uniform
  way in the range $[0,1]$;
\item both populations show a normal distribution in metallicity with
  an individual width;
\end{enumerate}

To test whether the assignment into populations is a valid one, we
want to check whether the population is in equilibrium with the
overall potential.

The routine then assigns each particle to one of the two populations,
based on its Mg metallicity. $75\pm4\%$ of all stars are assigned to
the correct underlying distribution on a mock dataset from the Gaia challenge. This
in turn changes the half-light radius by $110$pc and $-62$pc for
initial 390 pc, 730 pc half light radii. These changes are rather
high, but the two populations still show distinct half-light radii.

We explicitly assume two populations of stellar tracers in dwarf
galaxies, each with Gaussian distributions in metallicity with means
$\mu_1,\mu_2$. Without requiring a minimum distance $\delta
\mu=\mu_2-\mu_1$ between them, a representation with $\mu_1 \approx
\mu_2$ can be found. This model shows a higher $\chi^2$ than other
models and is thus disfavoured, but cannot be rejected from a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on a $p<0.05$ basis.

Here we show the influence of setting a prior minimal
$\delta\mu_{\min}$ on the goodness of fit, and the allowed range of
$\delta \mu$. We work on the metallicity distribution of one of the
mock dwarfs with cusped density profiles described earlier on, setting

\begin{equation} \mu_1\in[-1.0,2.0];\quad \delta \mu \in [
\delta\mu_{\min}, 5.0];\quad
\end{equation}

with $\delta\mu_{\min}$ varying from $0.0$ to $0.4$. We let the MCMC
run for a) 10k iterations with 8k burn-in/discarded models; b) 50k
iterations with 40k burn-in. From the accepted models, we compute the
mean Gaussian distributions and compare the corresponding overall
bimodal distribution to the actual metallicity distribution from the
data with a 2 component Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and take the
two-tailed statistics $p_{\text KS}$ from 30 drawings. If $p_{\text
KS}>0.05$, then we cannot reject the hypothesis that the distributions
of the two samples are the same.

Results for varying the minimal distance between the two Gaussians
between $0.0$ and $0.4$ are shown in fig ~\ref{fig:kit}.

\begin{figure*}
    \begin{center} \hspace{-7mm}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/10kit.pdf}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/50kit.pdf}
        \caption{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic $p_{\text KS}$ for
correspondance between models with $\delta\mu>\delta\mu_{\min}$ as
described in the text.}
        \label{fig:kit}
    \end{center}
\end{figure*}
All models with $p>0.05$ give a reasonable fit, with a maximum for 10k
iterations at around $\delta \mu = 0.1$. Models with $\delta \mu>0.2$
give no good fit anymore after 10k iterations.

The goodness of fit is enhanced if we take more iterations, so in the
plot for 50k iterations, there is a maximum $p=0.79$ compared to
$p=0.4$ from 10k iterations only. The whole curve is shifted to higher
$\delta \mu$ values. The models with $\delta \mu>0.3$ are
rejected. The restriction of $\delta \mu>0.4$ (last point to the
right) is well-fitting again, but this is due to the fact that the
fraction of particles for population 2 was found to be smaller than 10
percent, thus mainly fitting the metallicity distribution with one
Gaussian only, plus some skewing from an almost negligible stellar
component. Although this model cannot be rejected, it lies above the
rejected models at $\delta\mu_{\min}=0.4$. Furthermore, it does not
yield a second component with a scale length distinctly different from
the main component, rendering the additional gain from two components
obsolete. Thus, we will restrict the MCMC search of the population
fraction to the range $f\in[0.3,0.7]$.

\subsection{Baryonic Density Profiles}
Our Jeans-based method finds constraints on the overall mass density
profile

\begin{equation}
  \rho_{\rm tot} = \rho_{\rm DM}+\rho_{\rm bary}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm DM}$ is the dark matter density profile, and
$\rho_{\rm bary}$ is the baryonic density profile. As we are mostly
interested in the dark matter, we need to subtract the baryonic
contribution.

As the kinematic data we have is rather sparse -- not each star in the
dSph has its LOS velocity measured -- and misses other contributions
like gas, we subtract a photometrically defined baryonic density.

The errors on this density are rather small, thus we only use the
deprojected 3D photometric density profile for the subtraction,
without sampling over its errors, as is done for the kinematic tracer
population profiles.
