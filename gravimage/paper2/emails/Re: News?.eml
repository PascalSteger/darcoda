Hi Pascal,=20

So here what we should do:=20

	- Drop the mono prior. This clearly gets stuck/biased and is not =
working.=20
	- I like the n(r<r_half)<1.5 prior, but agree that we should =
probably extend the range to: n(r<r_half)<2
	- At the end of the day, any bias for the cusped models is =
*inside* r_half where we have little data constraint. The models do much =
better at the half light radius (or radii where there is more than one). =
So this is fine =3D no change required.=20
	- I think we need to write this up and publish now. Plots to =
include:=20

		- Default model: n(r<r_half)<2 prior; 5 bins; nbeta =3D =
4
		- Single pop verus 2 pop=20
		- Cusp versus core=20
		- Triaxial versus spherical=20
		- Appendix:=20
			- Changing number of bins=20
			- Removing n(r<r_half)<2 prior=20
			- Changing number of beta parameters [included =
here should be a plot showing how well we can recover the input beta =
using nbeta =3D 1,2,3,4,5 as you showed previously, but all on one =
plot].=20

That's it, then we can focus on applying the method to real data (paper =
II).=20

Thanks,=20

Justin=20
